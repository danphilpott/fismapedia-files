      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Intrusion detection is a topic 
        extensively discussed in the popular press, IT trade articles, scholarly 
        journals, and security newsletters. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) 
        hold great promise for deterring or mitigating the damage caused by "hacking" 
        or breaking into sensitive IT systems. Thus, IDSs are at the forefront 
        of many organizations’ attention and now their checkbooks. Careful planning, 
        phased deployments, and specialized training are among the steps that 
        can be taken to minimize the potential for costly deployments, poor returns 
        on investment, or high maintenance costs while maximizing the security 
        benefit to an organization. This <i>ITL Bulletin</i> provides basic information 
        about IDSs to help organizations avoid common pitfalls in acquiring, deploying, 
        and maintaining IDSs. The topics covered are:<BR>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>A Definition of Intrusion 
        Detection</B> <BR>
        Intrusion detection is the process of detecting unauthorized use of, or 
        attack upon, a computer or network. IDSs are software or hardware systems 
        that detect such misuse. IDSs can detect attempts to compromise the confidentiality, 
        integrity, and availability of a computer or network. The attacks can 
        come from attackers on the Internet, <i>authorized</i> insiders who misuse 
        the privileges given them, and <i>unauthorized</i> insiders who attempt 
        to gain unauthorized privileges.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Reasons to Acquire IDSs</B><BR>
        Intrusion detection capabilities are rapidly becoming necessary additions 
        to every large organization’s security infrastructure. The question for 
        security professionals should not be whether to use intrusion detection, 
        but which features and capabilities to use. However, one must still justify 
        the purchase of an IDS. There are at least three good reasons to justify 
        the acquisition of IDSs: to detect attacks and other security violations 
        that cannot be prevented, to prevent attackers from probing a network, 
        and to document the intrusion threat to an organization.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Detecting attacks that 
        cannot be prevented</U><BR>
        Attackers, using well-known techniques, can penetrate many networks. This 
        often happens when known vulnerabilities in the network cannot be fixed. 
        For instance, in many legacy systems, the operating systems cannot be 
        updated. In updateable systems, administrators may not have or take the 
        time to install all the necessary patches in a large number of hosts. 
        In addition, it is usually not possible to perfectly map an organization's 
        computer use policy to its access control mechanisms and thus authorized 
        users often can perform unauthorized actions. &nbsp;Users may also demand 
        network services and protocols that are known to be flawed and subject 
        to attack. Although, ideally, we would fix all vulnerabilities, this is 
        seldom possible. Therefore, an excellent approach for protecting a network 
        may be to use an IDS to detect when an attacker has penetrated a system 
        using an uncorrectable flaw. It is better at least to know that a system 
        has been penetrated so that administrators can perform damage control 
        and recovery than not to know that the system has been penetrated.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Preventing attackers from 
        probing a network</U><BR>
        A computer or network without an IDS may allow attackers to leisurely 
        and without retribution explore its weaknesses. If a single, known vulnerability 
        exists in such a network, a determined attacker will eventually find and 
        exploit it. The same network with an IDS installed is a much more formidable 
        challenge to an attacker. Although the attacker may continue to probe 
        the network for weaknesses, the IDS should detect these attempts, may 
        block these attempts, and can alert security personnel who can take appropriate 
        action.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Documenting the threat</U><BR>
        It is important to verify that a network is under attack or likely to 
        be attacked to justify spending money for securing the network. Furthermore, 
        it is important to understand the frequency and characteristics of attacks 
        in order to understand what security measures are appropriate for the 
        network. IDSs can itemize, characterize, and verify the threat from both 
        outside and inside attacks, thereby providing a sound foundation for computer 
        security expenditures. Using IDSs in this manner is important, since many 
        people mistakenly believe that no one (outsiders or insiders) would be 
        interested in breaking into their networks.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Types of IDSs</B><BR>
        There are several types of IDSs available today, characterized by different 
        monitoring and analysis approaches. Each has distinct uses, advantages, 
        and disadvantages. IDSs can monitor events at three different levels: 
        network, host, and application. IDSs can analyze these events using two 
        techniques: signature detection and anomaly detection. Some IDSs also 
        have the ability to automatically respond to the detected attacks. These 
        variations are discussed in the following sections.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>IDS Monitoring Approaches</B><BR>
        One way to delineate IDSs is to look at what they monitor. Some IDSs listen 
        on network backbones and analyze network packets to find attackers. Other 
        IDSs reside on the hosts that they are defending and monitor the operating 
        system for signs of intrusion. Still others monitor individual applications.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Network-Based IDSs</u><br>
        Network-based IDSs, currently the most common type of commercial product 
        offering, detect attacks by capturing and analyzing network packets. Listening 
        on a network backbone, a single network-based IDS can monitor a large 
        amount of information. Network-based IDSs usually consist of a set of 
        single-purpose hosts that "sniff" or capture network traffic in various 
        parts of a network and report attacks to a single management console. 
        Since no other applications run on the hosts used by a network-based IDS, 
        they can be secured against attack. Many of them even have "stealth" modes, 
        which make it extremely difficult for an attacker to detect their presence 
        and locate them.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Advantages:</i><br>
        </font>
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A few well-placed network-based 
          IDSs can monitor a large network. </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The deployment of network-based 
          IDSs has little impact upon an existing network. The network-based IDSs 
          are usually passive devices that listen on a network wire without interfering 
          with the normal operation of a network. Thus, it is usually easy to 
          retrofit a network to include network-based IDSs with a minimal installation 
          effort. </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Network-based IDSs can be 
          made very secure against attack and even made invisible to many attackers. 
          </font>
      </ul>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Disadvantages:</i><br>
      </font>
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Network-based IDSs may have 
          difficulty processing all packets in a large or busy network and, therefore, 
          may fail to recognize an attack launched during periods of high traffic. 
          Some vendors are attempting to solve this problem by implementing IDSs 
          completely in hardware, which is much faster. The need to analyze packets 
          quickly also forces vendors to try and detect attacks with as little 
          computing resources as possible, which may reduce detection effectiveness. 
          </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of the advantages of 
          network-based IDSs do not always apply to more modern switch-based networks. 
          Switches can subdivide networks into many small segments (usually one 
          fast Ethernet wire per host) and can provide dedicated links between 
          hosts serviced by the same switch. Most switches do not provide universal 
          monitoring ports and this reduces the monitoring range of a network-based 
          IDS sensor to a single host. In switches that do provide such monitoring 
          ports, often the single port cannot mirror all traffic traversing the 
          switch. </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Network-based IDSs cannot 
          analyze encrypted information. This increasingly will become a problem 
          as use of encryption becomes more popular both by organizations and 
          by attackers. </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most network-based IDSs 
          do not report whether or not an attack was successful, they only report 
          that an attack was initiated. After a detected attack, administrators 
          must manually investigate each attacked host to determine whether or 
          not the hosts were penetrated. </font>
      </ul>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Host-Based IDSs</u><br>
      Host-based IDSs operate by analyzing the activity on a particular computer. 
      As such, they must collect information from the host they are monitoring. 
      This allows an IDS to analyze activities on the host at a very fine granularity 
      and to determine exactly which processes and users are performing malicious 
      activities on the operating system. Some host-based IDSs simplify the management 
      of a set of hosts by having management functions and attack reports centralized 
      at a single security console. Others generate messages that are compatible 
      with network management systems.<p></p> </font>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Host-based IDSs can detect 
          attacks that are not detectable by a network-based IDS since they have

          systems reside on the host being attacked, host-based IDSs may be attacked

        Application-based IDSs monitor the events transpiring within an application. 
        Often application-based IDSs detect attacks by analyzing the application’s 
        log files. By interfacing with an application directly and having significant 
        domain or application knowledge, application-based IDSs are more likely 
        to have a more discerning or fine-grained view of suspicious activity 
        in the application.</font></p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>IDS Event Analysis Approaches</b><br>
        There are two primary approaches to analyzing events to detect attacks: 
        signature detection and anomaly detection. Signature detection is the 
        primary technique used by most commercial systems; however, anomaly detection 
        is the subject of much research and is used in a limited form by a number 
        of IDSs.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Signature-Based IDSs</u><br>
        Signature-based detection looks for activity that matches a predefined 
        set of events that uniquely describe a known attack. Signature-based IDSs 
        thus must be specifically programmed to detect each known attack. This 
        technique is extremely effective and is the primary method used in commercial 
        products for detecting attacks.</font></p>

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many signature-based IDSs 
          have narrowly defined signatures that prevent them from detecting variants 
          of common attacks. </font>
      </ul>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Anomaly-Based IDSs</u><br>
      Anomaly-based IDSs find attacks by identifying unusual behavior (anomalies) 
      on a host or network. They function on the observation that some attackers 
      behave differently than "normal" users and thus can be detected by systems 
      that identify these differences. Anomaly-based IDSs establish a baseline 
      of normal behavior by profiling particular users or network connections 
      and then statistically measure when monitored activity deviates from the 
      norm. Unfortunately, these IDSs often produce a large number of false alarms, 
      since normal user and network behavior can vary wildly. Despite this weakness, 
      researchers assert that anomaly-based IDSs are able to detect never-before-seen 
      attacks, unlike signature-based IDSs that rely on analysis of past attacks. 
      Although some commercial IDSs include restricted forms of anomaly detection, 
      few, if any, rely solely on this technology. However, anomaly detection 
      remains an active intrusion detection research area. <p></p> </font>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>IDSs that Automatically 
        Respond to Attacks</b><br>
        Since human administrators are not always available when an attack occurs, 
        some IDSs can be configured to automatically respond to attacks. The simplest 
        form of automated response is active notification. Upon detection of an 
        attack, an IDS may e-mail or page an administrator. A more active response 
        is to stop an attack in progress and then block future accesses by the 
        attacker. Typically, IDSs do not have the ability to block a particular 
        person, but instead block Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from which 
        an attacker is operating. It is very difficult to automatically stop a 
        determined and knowledgeable attacker, but IDSs often can deter expert 
        attackers or stop novice hackers by using the following capabilities:</font></p>
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cutting TCP connections 
          by injecting reset packets into the attacker’s connections to the target

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reconfiguring routers and 
          firewalls to block packets from the attacker’s location (IP address 
          or site), </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reconfiguring routers and 
          firewalls to block the protocols being used by an attacker, and </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In extreme situations, reconfiguring 
          routers and firewalls to sever all connections using particular network 
          interfaces. </font>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A more aggressive way to respond 
        to an attacker is to launch attacks against or attempt to actively gain 
        information about the attacker’s host or site. However, this response 
        can be extremely dangerous for an organization since it may be illegal 
        and cause damage to innocent Internet users. It is even more dangerous 
        to allow IDSs to automatically launch these attacks, but limited automated 
        "strike-back" strategies are sometimes used for critical systems. Obtain 
        legal advice before pursuing any of these options.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Tools that Complement IDSs</b><br>
        Several tools exist that complement IDSs and are often labeled as IDSs 
        by vendors since they perform similar functions. This section discusses 
        these tools and how they can enhance an organization’s intrusion detection 
        capability. </font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Honey Pot and Padded Cell 
        Systems</u><br>
        Several novel additions to the intrusion detection product line recently 
        hit the market and it is important to understand how these products differ 
        from traditional IDSs.<i>Honey pots</i> are decoy systems that attempt 
        to lure an attacker away from critical systems. These systems are filled 
        with information that is seemingly valuable but which has actually been 
        fabricated and which would not be accessed by an honest user. Thus, when 
        access to the honey pot is detected, there is a high likelihood that it 
        is an attacker. Monitors and event loggers on the honey pot detect these 
        unauthorized accesses and collect information about an attacker’s activities. 
        The purpose of the honey pot is to divert an attacker from accessing critical 
        systems, collect information about the attacker’s activity, and encourage 
        the attacker to stay on the system long enough for administrators to respond.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Padded cells</i> take a 
        different approach. Instead of trying to attract attackers with tempting 
        data, a padded cell waits for a traditional IDS to detect an attacker. 
        The attacker is then seamlessly transferred to a special padded cell host. 
        The attacker may not realize anything has happened, but the attacker is 
        now in a simulated environment where no harm can be caused. Like the honey 
        pot, this simulated environment can be filled with interesting data to 
        convince an attacker that the attack is going according to plan. Padded 
        cells offer unique opportunities to monitor the actions of an attacker. 
        IDS researchers have used padded cell and honey pot systems since the 
        late 1980s, but until recently no commercial products have been available.</font></p>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Vulnerability Assessment 
        Tools</u><br>
        Vulnerability assessment tools determine when a network or host is vulnerable 
        to known attacks. Since this activity is related to actually detecting 
        attacks, these tools are sometimes referred to as intrusion detection 
        tools. They come in two varieties: passive and active. Passive vulnerability 
        assessment tools scan the host on which they reside for insecure configurations, 
        software versions known to contain exploitable flaws, and weak passwords. 
        Active assessment tools reside on a single host and scan a network looking 
        for vulnerable hosts. The tool sends a variety of network packets at target 
        hosts, and from the responses, the tool can determine the server and operating 
        system software on each host. In addition, it can identify specific versions 
        of software and determine the presence or absence of security-related 
        patches. The active assessment tool compares this information with a library 
        of software version numbers known to be insecure and determines if the 
        hosts are vulnerable to known attacks.</font></p>

        Current intrusion detection products have limitations that one must be

      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite vendor claims, most 
          IDSs do not scale well as enterprise-wide solutions. The problems include 
          the lack of sufficient integration with other security tools and sophisticated 
          network management systems, the inability of IDSs to assess and visualize 
          enterprise-level threats, and the inability of organizations to investigate 
          the large number of alarms generated by hundreds or thousands of IDS 
          sensors. </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many IDSs create a large

          marketed as "real time" systems, during heavy network or host activity,

        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IDSs usually cannot detect 
          newly published attacks or variants of existing attacks. This can be 
          a serious problem as 30-40 new computer attacks are posted on the Web 
          every month. An attacker may simply wait for a new attack to be posted 
          and then quickly penetrate a target network. </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IDSs’ automated responses 
          are often ineffective against sophisticated attackers. They usually

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Deployment of IDSs</b><br>
        Intrusion detection technology is a necessary addition to every large 
        organization’s computer security framework. However, given the weaknesses 
        found in some of today’s products, and the relatively limited security 
        skill level of most system administrators, careful planning, preparation, 
        prototyping, testing, and specialized training are critical steps for 
        an effective IDS deployment.</font></p>
      <p> 
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NIST suggests performing a 
        thorough requirements analysis, carefully selecting the intrusion detection 
        strategy and solution that is compatible with the organization’s network 
        infrastructure, policies, and resource level. Organizations should consider 
        a staged deployment of IDSs to gain experience and to ascertain how many 
        monitoring and maintenance resources they will require. There is a large 
        variance in the resource requirements for each type of IDS. IDSs require 
        significant preparation and ongoing human interaction. Organizations must 
        have appropriate security policies, plans, and procedures in place so 
        that personnel will know how to react to the many and varied alarms IDSs 
        will produce. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We recommend consideration 
        of a combination of network-based IDSs and host-based IDSs to protect 
        an enterprise-wide network. First deploy network-based IDSs since they 
        are usually the simplest to install and maintain; then follow up by defending 
        critical servers with host-based IDSs. Honey pots should be used judiciously 
        and only by organizations with a highly skilled technical staff that are 
        willing to experiment with leading-edge technology. Padded cells are currently 
        unavailable except as research prototypes.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Deploying Network-Based 
        IDSs</u><br>
        There are many options for placing a network-based IDS and different advantages 
        for each location:
        </font></p>
      <blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Location: &nbsp;Behind 
        each external firewall<br>
        Advantage: &nbsp;Sees attacks that are penetrating the network’s perimeter 
        defenses from the outside world.<br>&nbsp;<br>

        Location: &nbsp;In front of an external firewall<br>
        Advantage: &nbsp;Proves that attacks from the Internet are regularly launched 
        against the network.<br>&nbsp;<br>

        Location: &nbsp;On major network backbones<br>
        Advantage: &nbsp;Detects unauthorized activity by those within a network 
        and monitors a large amount of a network’s traffic.<br>&nbsp;<br>

        Location: &nbsp;On critical subnets<br>
        Advantage: &nbsp;Detects attacks on critical resources. </font>
</blockquote>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Deploying Host-Based IDSs</u><br>
        Once an organization has deployed network-based IDSs, host-based IDSs 
        can offer an additional level of protection. However, it can be time-consuming 
        to install host-based IDSs on every host in an enterprise. Therefore, 
        it is often preferable to begin by installing host-based IDSs only on 
        critical servers. This placement will decrease the overall deployment 
        costs and allow limited personnel to focus on alarms generated from the 
        most important hosts. Once the operation and maintenance of host-based 
        IDSs is routine, more security-conscious organizations may consider installing 
        host-based IDSs on the majority of their hosts. In this case, purchase 
        host-based systems that have an easy-to-use centralized management and 
        reporting function since the management of alerts from a large set of 
        hosts can be daunting.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Future of IDSs</b><br>
        The IDS research field has been active since around 1985, but the wide-scale 
        commercial use of IDSs did not start until about 1996. In 1998, sales 
        of IDS tools reached $100 million. By all estimates, the market for IDS 
        tools should continue to grow strongly. From this history, it is apparent 
        that while the IDS research field is maturing, commercial IDSs are still 
        in their formative years. Some commercial IDSs have received negative 
        publicity due to their large number of false positives, overwhelming numbers 
        of attack reports, lack of scalability, and lack of integration with enterprise 
        management systems. However, given that commercial IDSs are still evolving 
        rapidly, we believe that these issues will be addressed quickly. The development 
        of IDS products is likely to parallel that of anti-virus software. Early 
        anti-virus software created false alarms on many normal user actions and 
        did not catch all known viruses. However, over time, anti-virus software 
        progressed to its current state, in which few users notice that it is 
        running and they have confidence that it detects all known viruses.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>For More Information</b><br>
        Acquiring, deploying, and maintaining an IDS is a complex task. Fortunately, 
        many excellent resources in the form of books and seminars exist to guide
