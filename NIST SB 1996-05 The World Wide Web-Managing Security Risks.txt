THE WORLD WIDE WEB:  MANAGING SECURITY RISKS
Computer users are finding the Internet and the World Wide Web
(or Web for short) extremely useful for browsing through
information, publishing documents, and exchanging information.
Web applications have become popular because of the availability
of powerful personal computers (PCs) capable of high quality
graphics, easy Internet access, and a simple hypertext markup
language (HTML) and network protocol. 

As a result, many organizations and individuals are becoming
Web-aware.  The Web offers all kinds of information, from
research papers, to customer support and marketing information,
to club calendars and family bulletin boards.  A myriad of Web
indexing and searching services allow readers to find what
they're looking for.  Organizations also use Internet protocols
to support their internal networks (often called intranets).

Although the Web is used for other applications such as
electronic commerce, the primary one is Internet publishing.
This CSL Bulletin addresses general security issues related to
the use of the World Wide Web, concentrating on risk management
for Web readers and publishers. 

A Web reader is anyone who uses a Web browser (a Web client
application which typically supports more than one Web protocol)
for access to Web-based information.  A Web publisher is a person
or organization that uses a Web server to provide information and
access to applications for internal or external users.

Note:  Any mention of particular technologies or commercial
products is for the purposes of explanation and illustration
only.  It does not imply a recommendation or endorsement by NIST
or the U.S. Department of Commerce.

WEB READERS
The goal of risk management is to balance expected gains against
unexpected losses, so as to maximize overall gain and minimize
loss.  Some readers may be using the Web just for fun, but
organizational users have more to lose (and gain).  Some of the
gains a Web reader might expect are:

  -  a more user-friendly interface;

  -  more timely access to information;

  -  access to more or previously unavailable information; and

  -  keeping current with technology.
                
Quantifying those gains can be difficult.  One measure would be
an estimate of how much more time would have been spent getting
the information via other means.  Potential losses are somewhat
easier to quantify.

Losses
Some of the more likely losses and their causes that a Web reader
faces are:

Damage to the system and user information from buggy software,
virus-infected executables, trojan horse programs, embedded
macros, and downloadable applets (an applet is a small program
that is downloaded and executed on-the-fly by the browser).  Some
recent viruses can even erase the boot EPROMs (Erasable
Programmable Read Only Memory) of some PCs, rendering them
unusable.

Monetary or credit damage from illegitimate companies or
Web-based scams, or by having credit card information stolen via
network sniffing or break-ins at the server.

Privacy can be compromised when information regarding a user's
browsing activities is published or sold.  The reader's Internet
address, date and time, and the names of the files accessed may
be recorded by the Web server.  If the Web reader fills out any
form, additional information may be recorded as well.

Reputation can be damaged by individuals who expose information
about the reader, or who masquerade as the reader and perform
antisocial acts.  For example, a Web applet could cause the Web
reader's browser to send email of the applet author's choice.

Most threats that the Web reader faces are not new, but the Web
makes them potentially more hazardous.  For example, viruses have
been around for years, but the point-and-click Web browser
interface makes it easy to instantly download and execute an
infected program.  Anyone with a telephone is exposed to
telemarketing scams, but a virtual Web storefront with fancy
graphics somehow seems more trustworthy than a stranger's voice
over the telephone.  Many companies collect and sell customer
purchase information, but one wouldn't expect the act of reading
an online brochure to add one's email address to a telemarketing
database.

Threats
Web threats stem from shortcuts in the software development
process, shortcomings in popular operating systems, deficiencies
in the Internet protocols, and the problems inherent in managing
the Internet.

Buggy software is endemic to the software development process.
Developers continually add new features to differentiate their
products and increase market share.  Users usually prefer to use
the latest and greatest version of any new Web client or server.
Much of the software is provided on a try-before-you-buy basis,
which allows people to test-drive software but provides no
warranty in the event of bugs.

Web browsers are especially hazardous because they can allow
access to untrustworthy systems on the Internet and they often
invoke other applications as a side effect of their use.  Some
may also act as an FTP (file transfer protocol) client, Usenet
news (Internet-based discussion groups) client, or an email
client.  Each new feature increases the risk of a dangerous bug.

Impersonation of an individual or organization is difficult to
prevent on the Internet.  Computer user identification is usually
meaningful only within an organization and depends on the
policies within that organization and how well they are enforced.
An email address may or may not uniquely identify an individual,
and many organizations do not provide outside access to internal
email addresses.  In any case, email is usually easy to forge,
being the electronic equivalent to a postcard written in pencil.
Although secure email protocols have been proposed, none has been
widely implemented.

When a browser connects to a Web server, the server gets the
Internet address of the connecting system.  If it is a multi-user
system, the server cannot tell what user on the system connected.
The address of a single-user PC may not be very useful either,
since systems using dial-up TCP/IP (Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol) may be assigned a different address
every time they connect.

Until recently, the agency responsible for registering most
Internet Domain names only confirmed that the requested name was
unique.  It did not require proof that a name like ORPHANS.ORG
was going to be used by a nonprofit organization or that WXY.COM
was an actual business entity.  Consequently, an Internet user
has no dependable way of identifying and authenticating an
individual or organization on the Internet.

Eavesdropping (also known as sniffing or snooping) of network
traffic is unavoidable as long as local area networks (LANs) use
broadcast protocols and the data are unencrypted and travel over
public networks.  You should be at least as cautious using the
Web for sensitive matters as you would be discussing something
confidential on a public or cellular telephone.

The costs associated with recovering from losses can be minor or
major.  Users can spend days recovering from a virus infection.
Data corruption is more difficult to discover and recover from,
since there may be no obvious symptoms.  Impersonation could
result in anything from a forged love letter to an order for
10,000 pizzas (with anchovies).

Risk Control
Some remedies exist to reduce some of the risks to a Web reader.
The easiest to implement are those based on loss avoidance.

  -  If you don't use the Web, you're not exposed to its dangers.
    
  -  If you never download executable code, your system won't be
     infected by a virus.

  -  If you don't buy things over the Web, you can't be cheated.

  -  If you never give out financial information (like credit
     card numbers or bank account numbers) over the Web, it can't
     be misused or stolen.

Other remedies are based on loss control or mitigation.

  -  Backup your system regularly.  Be sure that you can recover
     your software and data in the event of a crash or virus
     infestation.

  -  Be a careful shopper to reduce the danger of buggy software.
     Buy from known sources.  Don't run beta test code.  Buy the
     simplest browser that gets the job done.  Turn off features
     you don't use.  Don't download every viewer and applet you
     run across.

  -  If your organization has one, test new Web applications on a
     sacrificial computer system that is isolated from the
     internal network and doesn't contain any important data.

  -  Until better security mechanisms are in widespread use, if
     you must buy over the Internet, take some precautions.
     Check the identity of the vendor via another channel, e.g.,
     paper mail or telephone listing.  Patronize vendors that use
     a Web server with a secure channel between your system and
     theirs.

Impersonation
The problem of impersonation is somewhat difficult to solve.  An
organization can maintain tight controls over the hardware and
software of its intranet to make impersonating someone else
within the organization relatively difficult.  It can also
usually exercise some form of discipline over its members to
prevent or punish transgressions.  The greater Web is part of the
Internet, which is an international system of networks.  No one
has authority to prevent or punish abuses across the entire
Internet.

A form of public key encryption can be used to identify
individuals, computer systems, and organizations.  As yet, there
is no global infrastructure to support the management of the
keys.  Individual organizations can still choose to implement
this kind of identification for their intranet, and some
commercial Web servers and browsers implement a vendor-specific
form of key exchange so that Web servers can authenticate
themselves to browsers.

Eavesdropping
>From a technical perspective, the simplest remedy for
eavesdropping is to encrypt messages and channels.  However, the
use of encryption for confidentiality has the same drawbacks
associated with using encryption for personal identification.  It
is relatively easy to implement within an organization, but hard
to implement between organizations.  Encryption of all network
traffic can be expensive in terms of hardware, software, and
central processing unit (CPU) cycles.

Several commercial Web servers and browsers support encryption of
all Web requests between the browser and server. Currently, most
secure servers can only talk to browsers from the same vendor and
can only use keys from a limited set of key certificate
authorities.  Eventually, most Web vendors will be using Web
servers that provide public key-based authentication of the
server and encryption of the channel between the browser and
server.

Organizational Support for Readers
Organizations need to provide guidance and support to their Web
readers.  An organization should have clear, workable, and
enforceable Web usage and security policies.

Some measures an organization can take are:

  -  Buy licensed software from a trusted vendor;

  -  Run proactive virus checkers;

  -  Distribute approved browser configuration files and trusted
     viewers; and

  -  Educate your readers.  Tell them:

      -   what's allowable usage, covering issues like private
          email, Usenet posting, personal browsing, etc.;
     
      -   not to download unapproved browsers, viewers, and
          applets; and

      -   not to configure their Web browser to automatically
          invoke an application just because the Web server
          suggests it.

Particular technologies such as active forms or downloadable
applets must be carefully examined and approved before being
approved for organizational use.

WEB PUBLISHERS
Web publishers face the same challenges as Web readers.  They
need to recognize the potential losses from various threats and
implement risk reduction measures.

Losses
The types of losses a Web publisher can incur are similar to
those of a Web reader, namely:

Damage to their systems and networks from buggy and misconfigured
server software, insecure Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
programs, and untrustworthy server-side applets.

Monetary and credit damage by theft of service, nonpayment,
credit card fraud, etc.

Privacy can be compromised when the organization's or its
customers' confidential information is exposed.

Reputation can be damaged if information is changed or lost,
confidential customer information is exposed, or service is
denied.

Threats
Buggy or misconfigured Web server software can damage or allow
damage to information or software.  Security-related bugs have
been discovered in all of the popular UNIX-based Web servers.
Most of the bugs were caused by chronic UNIX/C errors in string
handling, environment variables, and the use of the system()
call.  Theoretically, since the source code was available for
most of the servers, the errors should have been immediately
spotted by the Internet users who downloaded the code. 
Practically, however, most users download a binary executable and
never look at the source code, or merely give it a cursory look
before compiling and installing it.  Users assume that someone
more conscientious than themselves has carefully studied the
code. 

Most Web servers provide some kind of access control; they can be
configured to accept or deny connections based on Internet
address or domain name.  There are several problems with this
method.  As described above, Internet addresses and domain names
are a weak identification method.  Also, unless you can configure
an attack computer with various addresses, it is difficult to
tell if your configuration rules are correct or if the Web server
author implemented the access control algorithms correctly.

Web servers support dozens of optional features.  The most
popular features are usually the best debugged, since other
people have already discovered the problems.  If you use
little-used or experimental features, you are the guinea pig.

CGI programs allow the Web server to execute an external program
when particular URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are accessed.
This provides a gateway to other programs that may query a
database or create on-the-fly HTML.  Unfortunately, it's easy to
create insecure CGI programs that allow an attacker to trick the
Web server into executing other programs.  Only careful
configuration of the Web server and CGI program, and careful
review of the CGI code, can prevent those mistakes.

If the Web server is broken into, it can serve as a stepping
stone to break into other networks and systems in the
organization.  The privacy of the organization and its customers
can be violated if confidential data are kept on the Web server.
Production systems could be damaged or brought down.  If
financial data are kept on the Web server, they could be altered
or stolen.  The reputation of the organization can be damaged if
information is maliciously altered or customers are denied
service.

Risk Control
Exercise central coordination of Web publishing in your
organization.  Establish procedures for verifying the security
and integrity of your Web servers and their contents.

Keep it simple.  Run the Web server on a stripped-down system,
i.e., turn off nonessential network protocols, create the minimum
necessary user accounts, and remove nonessential software.

Partition your systems to limit the damage that can be done.  For
example:

  -  Don't put confidential data on a publicly accessible server.

  -  Don't run a publicly accessible server on an internal
     production system or on your internal network.

  -  Store confidential customer data, like credit card
     information, on a tightly controlled system, apart from the
     Web documents.

  -  If possible, store read-only data on immutable media.

  -  Don't do program development on the server system.  Keep
     compilers off the server.

  -  Configure the network and internal systems such that the Web
     server system is not trusted.

  -  Don't allow that system access to internal resources, such
     as network filesystems, printers, and accounts.

Track Web software bug reports, especially security-related ones.
Track developments in Web security, in the areas of encryption,
authentication, and payment protocols.

Tell Web software vendors that quality is more important than
endless new features.

SUMMARY
You have to protect yourself, because all other controls are
after the fact.  The university may never discipline the student
who broke into your system.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation
may never find the money you lost in an interstate Internet scam.
You don't want to have to wait for Interpol to investigate your
case.

As the Internet and the World Wide Web evolve, you must continue
to educate yourself and your organization as new protocols, file
formats, applications, and products are introduced.
