    <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today’s rapidly changing technical 
      environment requires federal agencies to adopt a minimum set of management 
      controls to protect vital information technology (IT) resources. These management 
      controls are directed at individual IT users in order to reflect the distributed 
      nature of today’s technology. Technical and operational controls support 
      management controls. To be effective, all of these controls must interrelate.</font></p>
    <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Information Technology Laboratory 
      (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology recently published 
      Special Publication 800-18, <I><A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-18/Planguide.PDF">Guide 
      for Developing Security Plans for Information Technology Systems</A></I>. 
      Developed by Marianne Swanson and a working group of the Federal Computer 
      Security Program Managers’ Forum, the publication addresses the development 
      of security plans that document the management, technical, and operational 
      controls for federal automated information systems. The publication provides 
      guidance for individuals responsible for IT security at the system level 
      and at the organization level. It is written specifically for individuals 
      with little or no computer security expertise. The document can also be 
      used as an auditing tool by auditors, managers, and IT security officers. 
      The concepts presented are generic and can be applied to organizations in 
      private and public sectors. This <I>ITL Bulletin</I> summarizes the purpose, 
      responsibilities, format, and development of an effective security plan 
      (the guide provides detailed information).</font></p>
    <p><B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background</font></B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
      The completion of system security plans is a requirement of the Office of 
      Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, "Management of Federal Information 
      Resources," Appendix III, "Security of Federal Automated Information Resources," 
      updated in 1996, and of Public Law 100-235, "Computer Security Act of 1987." 
      OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, does not distinguish between sensitive 
      and non-sensitive systems. Rather, consistent with the Computer Security 
      Act of 1987, the Circular recognizes that federal automated information 
      systems have varied sensitivity and criticality. All federal systems have 
      some level of sensitivity and require protection as part of good management 
      practice. OMB Bulletin 90-08, dated July 9, 1990, which provided initial 
      security planning guidance, is superseded by the issuance of Special Publication 
      800-18. The generic term "system" is used in the document to mean either 
      a <I>major application</I> or a <I>general support system</I>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Major Application or General 
      Support System Plans</B><BR>
      All applications and systems must be covered by system security plans if 
      they are categorized as a "major application" or "general support system". 
      Specific security plans for other applications are not required because 
      the security controls for those applications or systems would be provided 
      by the general support systems in which they operate. For example, a department-wide 
      Financial Management System would be a major application requiring its own 
      security plan. A local program designed to track expenditures against an 
      office budget might not be considered a major application and would be covered 
      by a general support system security plan for an office automation system 
      or a local area network (LAN). Standard commercial off-the-shelf software 
      (such as word processing software, electronic mail software, utility software, 
      or other general- purpose software) would not typically be considered a 
      major application and would be covered by the plans for the general support 
      system on which they are installed.</font></p>

      The system owner is responsible for ensuring that the security plan is prepared 
      and for implementing the plan and monitoring its effectiveness. Security 
      plans should reflect input from various individuals with responsibilities 
      concerning the system, including functional "end users," information owners, 
      the system administrator, and the system security manager.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Agencies may require contractor 
      compliance with the guide as a contract requirement. A security plan in 
      the format specified in the document or in another agreed-upon format is 
      suggested in those cases where vendors are operating a system under contract 
      to the federal government. In those instances where a contractor or other 
      entity (e.g., state or local government) operates a system that supports 
      a federal function, a security plan is required.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OMB Circular A-130 requires a 
      summary of the security plan to be incorporated into the strategic IRM plan 
      required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Agencies should develop policy 
      on the security planning process. Security plans are living documents that 
      require periodic reviews, modifications, and milestone or completion dates 
      for planned controls. Procedures should be in place outlining who reviews 
      the plans and follows up on planned controls. In addition, procedures are 
      needed describing how security plans will be used in the authorization for 
      processing process.</font> </p>
    <p><B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recommended Format</font></B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
      While the format in Special Publication 800-18 is recommended, it is recognized 
      that some agencies have developed plans using other formats that meet A-130 
      requirements. The document is intended as guidance only and should not be 
      construed as the only format allowed. A standardized approach, however, 
      not only makes the development of the plan easier by providing examples, 
      but also provides a baseline to review plans. The level of detail included 
      within the plan should be consistent with the criticality and value of the 
      system to the organization’s mission (i.e., a more detailed plan is required 
      for systems critical to the organization’s mission). The security plan should 
      fully identify and describe the controls currently in place or planned for 
      the system and should include a list of <I>rules of behavior</I> (see Appendices 
      A and B of the document).</font></p>
    <p><B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">System Analysis</font></B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
      Once completed, a security plan will contain technical information about 
      the system, its security requirements, and the controls implemented to provide 
      protection against its risks and vulnerabilities. Before the plan can be 
      developed, a determination must be made as to which type of plan is required 
      for a system. An analysis of the system determines the boundaries of the 
      system and the type of system.</font></p>
    <p><I><B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">System Boundaries</font></B></I><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">	
      Defining what constitutes a "system" for the purposes of the guideline requires 
      an analysis of system boundaries and organizational responsibilities. Constructing 
      logical boundaries around a set of processes, communications, storage, and 
      related resources, as defined by the guideline, identifies a system. The 
      elements within these boundaries constitute a single system requiring a 
      security plan. Each element of the system must:</font></p>

    </UL>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All components of a system need 
      not be physically connected (e.g., a group of stand-alone personal computers 
      (PCs) in an office; a group of PCs placed in employees’ homes under defined 
      telecommuting program rules; a group of portable PCs provided to employees 
      who require mobile computing capability for their jobs; and a system with 
      multiple identical configurations that are installed in locations with the 
      same environmental and physical safeguards).</font></p>
    <p> <i><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Multiple Similar Systems</font></B></I><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      An organization may have systems that differ only in the responsible organization 
      or the physical environment in which they are located (e.g., air traffic 
      control systems). In such instances, it is appropriate and recommended to 
      use plans that are identical except for those areas of difference. This 
      approach provides consistent levels of protection for similar systems. </font></p>
    <p><I><B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">System Category</font></B></I><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
      The next step is to categorize each system as either a "<I>major application</I>" 
      or as a "general support system." All applications should be covered by 
      a security plan. The applications will either be covered individually if 
      they have been designated as a major application or within the security 
      plan of a general support system. A system may be designated as a major 
      application even though it is also supported by a system that has been designated 
      as a general support system. For example, a LAN may be designated a general 
      support system and have a security plan. The organization’s accounting system 
      may be designated as a major application even though the computing and communication 
      resources of the LAN support it. In this example, the major application 
      requires additional security requirements due to the sensitivity of the 
      information the application processes. When a security plan is required 
      for a major application that is supported by a general support system, coordination 
      of both plans is required.</font></p>
    <p><I><B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Major Applications</font></B></I><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
      All federal applications have value and require some level of protection. 
      Certain applications, because of the information they contain, process, 
      or transmit or because of their criticality to the organization’s missions, 
      require special management oversight. These applications are major applications.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Agencies are expected to exercise 
      management judgment in determining which of their applications is a major 
      application and to ensure that the security requirements of non-major applications 
      are discussed as part of the security plan for the applicable general support 
      systems.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Major applications are systems 
      that perform clearly defined functions for which there are readily identifiable 
      security considerations and needs (e.g., an electronic funds transfer system). 
      A major application might comprise many individual programs and hardware, 
      software, and telecommunications components. These components can be a single 
      software application or a combination of hardware/software focused on supporting 
      a specific mission-related function. A major application may also consist 
      of multiple individual applications if all are related to a single mission 
      function (e.g., payroll or personnel). If a system is defined as a major 
      application and the application is run on another organization's general

      A general support system is interconnected information resources under the

      All security plans, at a minimum, should be marked, handled, and controlled

      all security plans should be dated for ease of tracking modifications and

      The plan begins with listing the name and title of the system/application. 
      Each system/application should be assigned a unique name/identifier. Assigning 
      a unique identifier to each system helps to ensure that appropriate security 
      requirements are met based on the unique requirements for the system, and 
      that allocated resources are appropriately applied. Further, the use of 
      unique system identifiers is integral to the IT system investment models 
      and analyses established under the requirements of the Information Technology 
      Management Reform Act of 1996 (also known as the Clinger-Cohen Act). The 
      identifier could be a combination of alphabetic and numeric characters and 
      can be used in combination with the system/application name. The unique 
      name/identifier should remain the same throughout the life of the system

      System interconnection, if not appropriately protected, may result in a

      transmit. It is important that system operators, information owners, and 
      management obtain as much information as possible about the vulnerabilities 
      associated with system interconnection and information sharing and the increased 
      controls required to mitigate those vulnerabilities. The security plan for
