      <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The basic principles of results-based 
        training for information technology (IT) security were discussed in our 
        <A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/">April 1998 bulletin</A>, 
        <B>Training Requirements for Information Technology Security: An Introduction 
        to Results-Based Learning</B>. This learning approach trains staff members 
        according to their roles and responsibilities within their organizations 
        and recommends that organizations evaluate the results of the training. 
        Both this bulletin and the April bulletin were excerpted from NIST <B>Special 
        Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements: 
        A Role- and Performance-Based Model</B>. The training requirements were 
        developed by the Federal Computer Security Program Managers Forum and 
        by the Federal Information Systems Security Educators' Association (FISSEA). 
        The complete publication is available in paper copy from the Government 
        Printing Office and in electronic format from NIST's Web pages: </font>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>The Role- and Performance-Based 
        Model</B> </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Results-based training for 
        information technology (IT) security focuses on the job functions that 
        individuals perform, and on their specific roles and responsibilities 
        within their organizations. The results-based approach to learning is 
        based on the premise that individuals have unique backgrounds and different 
        ways of learning. Another consideration is that individuals may have more 
        than one role in the organization, and they may need information technology 
        security training that is tailored for the specific responsibilities of 
        each role. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The role- and performance-based 
        model presented in NIST Special Publication 800-16 provides a systematic 
        and integrated framework for identifying training needs throughout the 
        organization and for ensuring that individuals receive the training that 
        they need. The framework relates job function to the IT security knowledge 
        that is required to carry out a specific job. Managers can then identify 
        needed training for their staff members, understand the consequences of 
        not providing adequate training, and plan and schedule training according 
        to organizational priorities. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the model, learning is 
        represented as a continuum that starts with awareness, continues with 
        training, and evolves into education. Awareness about IT security is the 
        point-of-entry into the learning process for all employees. The next step 
        is training, which starts with instruction on security basics and literacy, 
        and then carries through with instruction in a wide range of security-related 
        skills needed by employees for their specific roles and responsibilities. 
        The capstone of the learning continuum is education, which creates the 
        expertise needed by the organization's IT security specialists and professionals. 
        </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The model is very useful in 
        helping managers meet their responsibilities for training staff members. 
        In addition, the model helps course developers identify the learning outcomes 
        expected for individuals with various roles and responsibilities. As a 
        result, IT security course material can be developed in basic modules 
        and then appropriately customized to meet the needs of individual staff 
        members. </font>
      <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Evaluating the Effectiveness 
        of Training</B> </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Training based on organizational 
        and staff members' needs is a good investment for the organization. But 
        to receive the benefits, the organization must ensure that the contents 
        of the training are current and appropriate for the audience, and that 
        the training is delivered in an effective manner. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As part of their regular processes 
        for the wise management of resources, organizations should evaluate the 
        scope of their IT security training needs and the effectiveness of the 
        training provided. Evaluations enable decision-makers to allocate their 
        training resources sensibly and to derive the greatest return on their 
        training investments. When training resources are well-managed, the organization 
        benefits both from improved IT security and from stronger management support 
        for the IT security activities. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The evaluation process starts 
        with identifying what can be measured. Some aspects of training for which 
        evaluation data can be collected include the following:</font>
      <P> 
      <UL TYPE="SQUARE">
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The learner's satisfaction 
          with the training - the extent to which the conditions were right for 
          learning.<br>

        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Learning effectiveness 
          - what an individual has learned from a specific course or training

        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Teaching effectiveness 
          - the pattern of learner outcomes following a specific course or training 
          event.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>

        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Program effectiveness - 
          the value of the specific class or training event, compared to other 
          options in the context of an organization's overall IT security training 
          program. </font>
      </UL>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The time and resources spent 
        in conducting training evaluations can be beneficial to employees, managers, 
        and trainers. Employees benefit by being able to assess their own post-training 
        job performance. Managers can use the evaluations to assess the subsequent 
        on-the-job performance of staff members. In addition, managers can use 
        the evaluations to make decisions about how to allocate limited resources 
        among the various IT security activities in the continuum from awareness, 
        security literacy, and training to education. Another benefit is that 
        trainers can use trend data acquired from evaluations to improve both 
        their teaching and student learning. </font>
      <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Developing an Evaluation 
        Plan</B> </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is difficult to get good 
        information for evaluating learner satisfaction and the effectiveness 
        of training programs. Written learning objectives, stated in an observable, 
        measurable way, are needed to evaluate student learning. To evaluate teaching, 
        it is necessary to collect trend and other related data. Mission-related 
        goals must be identified and related to learning objectives in order to 
        evaluate returns on investment. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Before initiating evaluations, 
        organizations should develop plans for gathering the evaluation information 
        that they need. The following are suggested elements to be included when 
        developing the evaluation plan: </font>
      <UL TYPE="SQUARE">
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>A written description 
          of existing conditions prior to, and in preparation for, the learning 
          activity</B>. Certain conditions must be present to forecast training 
          effectiveness. Does the student need a checklist, a set of items to 
          manipulate, or an outline of the information? Does the instructor need 
          audiovisual equipment, handouts, or a classroom with furniture set up 
          in a specific format? Conditions of the learning activity, including 
          computer-based training (CBT), must be specific and comprehensive.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          </font>
        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>The activity to be performed.</B> 
          The evaluation plan must state the activity to be performed in a manner 
          permitting the evaluator to actually observe the behavior that the student 
          is to learn. Observations can be done in class by the teacher or on 
          the job by the supervisor. It is very difficult and impractical to measure 
          the process of a student's changing attitude or thinking through a task 
          or problem. The evaluator, however, can measure a written exercise, 
          a demonstration of skill, a verbal or written discussion, or any combination 
          of these demonstrable activities. Rather than merely acknowledging that 
          the student was exposed to certain information, the evaluator should 
          observe the skill being performed or the information being applied. 
          In computer-based training, evaluation measurement can be programmed 
          to occur at the instructional unit level, with subsequent units adjusted 
          based on student response. In other instructional methods, adjustments 
          can be made in real time by the instructor based on the nature of student 
          questions during the course. Adjustments can also be made between courses 
          in a student's training sequence.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          </font>
        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Measures of success 
          derived from the individual's normal work products rather than from 
          classroom testing.</B> This directly ties the individual's performance 
          to the impact on the organization's mission. Written behavioral objectives 
          for a learning activity must include a stated level of success. For 
          example, quantitative skills can be expressed as being performed successfully 
          every time, 10 out of 100 times, or 5 out of 10 times, and the impact 
          or consequences can be noted. Risk management techniques should be used 
          to establish the criticality of quantitative skills. Qualitative skills 
          can be measured by distinguishing satisfactory performance from poor 
          performance, or outstanding performance from satisfactory performance. 
          Measurements of qualitative skills might include the amount of repeat 
          work required on the part of the learner, customer satisfaction, or 
          peer recognition of the employee as a source of IT security information.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The nature and purpose 
          of the training activity, and whether it is at a beginning, intermediate, 
          or advanced level, will influence the setting of success measures. This 
          is a subjective goal. If success levels are not documented, an individual 
          student's achievement of the behavioral learning objectives cannot be 
          evaluated, nor can the learning activity itself be evaluated as part 
          of the organization's overall training program. </font>
      </UL>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In addition to the written 
        objectives suggested above, the evaluation plan should show how the data 
        will be collected and used. This step will help to stimulate support for 
        the cost and effort of the data collection. </font>
      <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>The Levels of Evaluation</B> 
        </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There are four levels of evaluation 
        that progress from relatively simple to rather complex. These levels of 
        evaluation are related to the four purposes of evaluation. </font>
      <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Level 1: End-of-Course 
        Evaluations</B> (Student Satisfaction)</font>
      <P> 
      <dl> 
        <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A common term for this type 
          of evaluation is "the 'Smiley Face' evaluation." For example, Likert 
          Scale-type forms ask the student to check a range of options from "poor" 
          to "excellent" indicating the student's feelings about the training 
          activity. The responses indicate the perceptions of the student and 
          provide information about the conditions for learning. At this level 
          of evaluation, questions could be asked about the student's satisfaction 
          with the training facility and instructor, the manner of presentation 
          of the content, and whether or not course objectives met the student's 
          expectations. Although this type of evaluation does not provide in-depth

        <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Measurement of training 
          effectiveness depends on an understanding of the background and skill 
          levels of the people being trained. For example, technical training 
          provided to a group of systems analysts and programmers will have a 
          different level of effect than the same information provided to a group 
          of accountants. Basic demographic data may be collected at the beginning 
          or conclusion of the course. Information about the learners' satisfaction 
          with the course and course material should be collected at the end of 
          the course.</font>

      <P> 
      <dl> 
        <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This level of evaluation 
          measures how much information or the level of skill that was transmitted 
          to the student participating in the training activity. The evaluation 
          could be in various formats relative to the level of training. Participants 
          in an IT security basic and literacy course could be given tests both 
          before and after the course. At an intermediate or advanced training 
          level, participants could be given a performance test, such as a case 
          study to analyze. At the education level, essay questions exploring 
          concepts would be appropriate. The evaluation format must relate to 
          the behavioral objectives of the learning activity. This, in turn, drives 
          the content being presented. The Level 2 evaluation provides instant 
          feedback and is more objective than a Level 1 evaluation. Behavior objective 
          testing assesses how much the student remembered or measures skills 
          demonstrated by the student's performance at the end of the program. 
          Level 2 evaluations can be built into each unit of instruction as the 
          course progresses.</font>
          <P> 
        <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Level 2 evaluation measures 
          success in the transfer of information and skills to the student. It 
          enables the evaluator to determine if a given student needs to repeat 
          the course or attend a different type of learning activity that presents 
          the same material in a different format. The evaluator should be able 
          to see if a pattern of transfer problems exists and to determine whether 
          or not the course itself may need to be revised or dropped from an organization's 
          training program.</font>
          <P> 
        <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Behavior objective testing 
          is possibly the most difficult measurement area to address. It is relatively 
          easy to test the knowledge level of the attendees after completing a 
          course or unit of instruction but it is not easy to determine when that 
          learning took place. An attendee may have had knowledge of the subject 
          area before receiving the instruction and participation in the course 
          may have had little or no impact in expanding knowledge. As a result, 
          information collected solely at the conclusion of a course or instructional 
          unit must be examined with respect to the attendee's background and 
          education.</font>
          <P> 
        <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An approach to determining 
          the learning impact of a specific course or instructional unit is to 
          test at the outset of the training and at the conclusion of the training 
          and to compare the results. At the beginning and intermediate levels, 
          it is appropriate to test a student's knowledge of a particular subject 
          area by including questions or tasks where there is only a single right 
          answer or approach. Questions regarding selection of the "best" answer 
          among possible options should be reserved for those training environments 
          where there is opportunity for analyzing why a particular answer is 
          better than other answers. </font>

      <P> 
      
      <dd><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This evaluation is the first 
        level that asks for more than student input. At this level, the evaluator, 
        through a structured questionnaire usually administered 30 to 60 days 
        following the training activity, asks the supervisor about the performance 
        of the employee relative to the behavioral objectives of the course. This 
        is a "before" and "after" job skills comparison. In some cases this information 
        is difficult to obtain, especially when employees' job functions and grade 
        levels permit them considerable autonomy, without direct supervision. 
        Developing a valid questionnaire can be a challenge when supervisors observe 
        only the result of employee actions. Nevertheless, a Level 3 evaluation, 
        when it is successfully done, should begin to show the extent to which 
        the learning activity benefits the organization as well as the employee.</font>

            be difficult to undertake and hard to quantify. Among the possible 
            approaches are structured, follow-up interviews with students, their

            by a subject-matter expert of outputs produced by a student both before 
            and after training. Still another approach could be some form of benchmarking 
            or evaluation of the particular training activity in relation to other 
            options for a particular job performance measure. In all cases, these

            help senior managers answer questions about the most cost-effective 
            way to spend limited training resources. For example, it may be more 
            beneficial for the organization to focus resources on the education 
            of a single, newly appointed IT security specialist rather than to 
            train all employees in security basics and literacy. Or perhaps there 
            might be a better return on investment to train 'front-end' systems 
            designers and developers in building security rules commensurate with 
            the sensitivity of the system, rather than train 'back-end' users 
            in compliance with currently existing system rules. Determination 
            of the purpose and objectives of a Level 4 evaluation, as well as 
            the number of variables and the method of measurement of skill level, 
            should be done following the completion of Level 3 evaluations and 
            after a thorough review of the findings. </font>
