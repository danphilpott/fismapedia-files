      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Web site is a powerful tool 
        that enables businesses, government, and private users to share information 
        and conduct business on the Internet. Organizations - small and large, 
        private and public - are devoting many resources to creating attractive, 
        attention-getting Web sites, but they may be neglecting basic security 
        controls. Recent attacks on Web sites have shown that the computers that 
        support Web sites are vulnerable to attacks that can range from minor 
        nuisances to significant interruptions of service. This ITL Bulletin discusses 
        the most commonly employed methods for protecting Web servers and provides 
        practical guidance on steps that organizations can take to reduce the 
        threat of attacks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Creating a Plan to Secure 
        Your Web Server</B><BR>
        While most incidents cause minor embarrassment or inconvenience, it is 
        possible for an intruder to cause real problems and severe losses. Every 
        organization should establish a security program that assesses the risks 
        of attacks and takes steps to reduce the risks to an acceptable level. 
        Each organization has to decide its sensitivity to risk and how open it 
        wants to be to the external world. When resources are limited, the cost 
        of security incidents should be considered, and the investment in protective 
        measures should be concentrated on areas of highest sensitivity.</font></p>

      </UL>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Upgrading Software/Installing 
        Patches</U><BR>
        One of the simplest and yet most effective techniques for reducing risk 
        is the installation of the latest software updates and patches. Web servers 
        should be frequently (sometimes daily) examined to determine what software 
        needs to be updated or patched. (NIST is actively working with other government 
        agencies to develop tools to assist in the finding and applying of patches. 
        When available, details will appear on the NIST Computer Security Resource 
        Clearinghouse [http://csrc.nist.gov].) Any software on a Web server that 
        an attacker could use to penetrate the system must be regularly updated. 
        Software in this category includes the operating system, servers or any 
        software that receives network packets, software running as root or administrator, 
        and security software. The following process should be followed:</font></p>
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Make a list of such software 
          and write down the associated version numbers. </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Find the Web page for each 
          piece of software and make sure that you have installed the latest version. 
          </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Find and install the available 
          patches for the applicable version of the software. Each software vendor 
          provides unique instructions on how to install its patches and usually 
          these instructions are very simple. Be careful to follow vendor instructions; 
          patches must often be installed in a set sequence for the process to 
          work. </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Verify that patched software 
          functions correctly. </font>
      </UL>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Using Single-Purpose Servers</U><BR>
        Organizations should run Web servers on computers dedicated exclusively 
        to that task. A common mistake is to try to save money by running multiple 
        servers on the same host. For example, it is not uncommon to run an e-mail 
        server, Web server, and database server on the same computer. However, 
        each server run on a host provides an attacker with avenues for attack. 
        Each newly installed server then increases the organization's reliance 
        upon that host while simultaneously decreasing its security. Given the 
        decreasing cost of hardware and the increasing importance of having fast 
        Web servers, it is generally effective to buy a dedicated host for each 
        Web server. Also, in situations where a Web server constantly interacts 
        with a database, it is best to use two separate hosts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Removing Unnecessary Applications</U><BR>
        All privileged software not specifically required by the Web server should 
        be removed. For the purposes of this document, privileged software is 
        defined as software that runs with administrator privileges or that receives 
        packets from the network. Operating systems often run a variety of privileged 
        programs by default. Many systems administrators are not even aware of 
        the existence of many of these programs. Each privileged program provides 
        another avenue by which an attacker can compromise a Web server. It is 
        therefore crucial that Web servers be purged of unnecessary programs. 
        For greater security and because it is often difficult to identify what 
        software is privileged, many systems administrators remove all software 
        not needed by a Web server.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>External Firewalls</U><BR>
        Install public Web servers outside of an organization's firewall. In this 
        configuration, the firewall prevents the Web server from sending packets 
        into an organization's network. If an attacker on the Internet penetrates 
        the external Web server, they have no more access to the organization's 
        internal network than they had before. If a Web server is inside the organization's 
        firewall and is penetrated by an attacker on the Internet, the attacker 
        can use the Web server as a launching point for attacks on the internal 
        systems. Thus, these attacks would completely bypass the security provided 
        by the firewall.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Remote Administration Security</U><BR>
        Since it is often inconvenient to administer a host from the physical 
        console, system administrators often install software on Web servers to 
        allow remote administration. From a security perspective, this practice 
        is dangerous and should be minimized or eliminated. In order to increase 
        the security where this practice is necessary:</font></p>
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Encrypt remote administration 
          traffic such that attackers monitoring network traffic cannot obtain 
          passwords or inject malicious commands into conversations. </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Use packet filtering (see 
          description below) to allow remote administration only from a designated 
          set of hosts. </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Maintain this designated 
          set of hosts at a higher degree of security than normal hosts. </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Do not use packet filtering 
          as a replacement for encryption since attackers can spoof Internet Protocol 
          (IP) addresses. (With IP spoofing, an attacker lies about their location 
          by sending messages from an IP address other than their own. </font>
      </UL>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Restrict Server Scripts</U><BR>
        Most Web sites contain scripts (small programs) created locally by Web 
        site developers. A Web server runs these scripts when a user requests 
        a particular page. Attackers can use these scripts to penetrate Web sites 
        by finding and exercising flaws in the code. To find such flaws, an attacker 
        does not necessarily need the script source code. Scripts must be carefully 
        written with security in mind and system administrators should inspect 
        them before placing them on a Web site. Do not allow scripts to run arbitrary 
        commands on a system or to launch insecure (or non-patched) programs. 
        Scripts should restrain users to doing a small set of well-defined tasks. 
        They should carefully restrict the size of input parameters so that an 
        attacker cannot give a script more data than it expects. If an attacker 
        is allowed to do this, a system can often be penetrated using a technique 
        called buffer overflow. (With a buffer overflow attack, an attacker convinces 
        a Web server to run arbitrary code by giving it more information than 
        it expected to receive.) Run scripts with non-administrator privileges 
        to prevent an attacker from compromising the entire Web server in the 
        event that a script contains flaws.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Web Server Shields with 
        Packet Filtering</B><BR>
        A router set up to separate a Web server from the rest of the network 
        can shield a Web server from many attacks. The router can thwart attacks 
        before they reach the Web server by dropping all packets that do not access 
        valid Web server services. Typically, the router should drop all network 
        packets that do not go either to the Web server (port 80) or to the remote 
        administration server being used. For additional security, only allow 
        a pre-approved list of hosts to send traffic to a Web server's remote 
        administration server. By doing so, an attacker can only compromise a 
        Web server using the remote administration server via a restricted set 
        of network paths. The filtering router shield offers similar protection 
        to that of removing all unneeded software from a host since it prevents 
        an attacker from requesting certain vulnerable services. Be aware that 
        setting up a router with many filtering rules may noticeably slow its 
        ability to forward packets.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Education and Personnel 
        Resource Allocation</U><BR>
        Attackers are able to penetrate most Web servers because the systems administrators 
        are either not knowledgeable about Web server security or did not take 
        the time to properly secure the system. Web site administrators must be 
        trained about Web server security techniques and rewarded for spending 
        time securing the site. Several excellent books and training seminars 
        exist to aid administrators in securing Web sites.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Separation of Privilege</B><BR>
        Regardless of the security measures established for a Web server, penetration 
        may still occur. If this happens, it is important to limit the attacker's 
        actions on the penetrated host. Separation of privilege is a key concept 
        for restricting actions once a part of the host is penetrated. To establish 
        such control, [ER3]partition the various host resources among a set of 
        user accounts. An attacker who penetrates some software will then be limited 
        to acting within that single user account instead of having control over 
        the entire system. For example, a Web server can run as one user, but 
        the Web pages can be owned by another user and with the Web server given 
        read-only access. Then, if attackers penetrate the Web server, they [ER4]cannot 
        change the Web pages owned by other users. Likewise, intrusion detection 
        software can run as another user to protect it from being modified by 
        an attacker penetrating the Web server user. For the best security, run 
        the Web server process as a user that has write privilege only in a few 
        privately owned temporary directories. This requires storing the Web server 
        software as read-only under one user but running it as a different user.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Hardware-Based Solutions</U><BR>
        Hardware can implement separation of privilege concepts with a greater 
        degree of security than software because hardware is not as easily modified 
        as software. With software implementations, if the underlying operating 
        system is penetrated, the attacker has complete control of all files on 
        a Web server. Using read-only external hard disks or CD-ROMs, Web pages 
        and even critical software can be stored in a way that an attacker cannot 
        modify the files. The usual configuration is for the Web server to have 
        a read-only port to the external hard disk while another well-protected 
        computer has a read-write port so that the Web pages can be updated. Note 
        that an attacker who penetrates a protected Web server can still copy 
        data, change the copied data, and serve up the changed pages.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Internal Firewalls</U><BR>
        Modern Web servers often serve as front ends to complex and possibly distributed 
        applications. In this situation, a Web server often communicates with 
        several other hosts, each of which contains particular data or performs 
        particular computations. It is tempting to locate these computers inside 
        of an organization's firewall for ease of maintenance and to protect these 
        important computers. However, if an attacker can compromise a Web server, 
        these back end systems may be penetrated using the Web server as a launching 
        point. Instead, it is a good idea to separate the Web server back end 
        systems from the rest of the organization's networks using an internal 
        firewall. Then, penetration of the Web server and subsequently the Web 
        server's back end systems does not provide access to the rest of the organization's 
        networks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Network-Based Intrusion 
        Detection</U><BR>
        Despite all attempts to patch a Web server and to securely configure it, 
        vulnerabilities may still exist that are known to the outside world. Also, 
        the Web server may be perfectly secure but an attacker may cleverly overwhelm 
        the host's services such that it ceases to operate. In this kind of environment, 
        it is important to know when your Web server has been compromised or shut 
        down so that service can be quickly restored. Network-based intrusion 
        detection systems (IDSs) monitor network traffic to determine whether 
        a Web server is under attack or has been compromised or disabled. Modern 
        IDSs have the ability to launch a limited response[ER7] to attacks or 
        notify systems administrators via e-mail, pagers, or messages on a security 
        console. Typical automated responses include killing network connections 
        and blocking sets of IP addresses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><U>Host-Based Intrusion Detection</U><BR>
        Host-based IDSs reside on a Web server. Thus, they are better positioned 
        to determine the state of the Web server than a network-based IDS. They 
        provide the same benefits as network-based IDSs and in some circumstances 
        can detect attacks better because they have finer grained access to the 
        Web server's state. However, some drawbacks exist. An attacker that penetrates 
        a Web server can disable a host-based IDS, thereby preventing it from 
        issuing a warning. In addition, remote denial-of-service (DOS) attacks 
        [ER8]often disable host-based IDSs while disabling the Web server. Remote 
        DOS attacks enable an attacker to remotely shut down a Web server without 
        actually penetrating it. Thus, host-based IDSs are useful but they should 
        be used in conjunction with the typically more secure network-based IDSs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Limitations of Existing 
        Solutions and Gaining Additional Assurance</B><BR>
        Considerable research addresses issues of proving software secure. In 
        some cases, it is possible to do this but it is very costly and time-consuming. 
        Usually, by the time software is proven secure, it is obsolete and replaced 
        with an unproven new version. Therefore, today's software is not proven 
        secure and application of standard Web security techniques cannot guarantee 
        that a Web server will be impenetrable.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, a Web server can be 
        made quite resistant to attacks by using the stated Web server security 
        techniques in addition to using trustworthy software. By trustworthy, 
        we mean software that can be demonstrated by some measure to be secure. 
        The security afforded by software can be assessed by studying past vulnerabilities, 
        using software specifically created with security as the principle goal, 
        and using software evaluated by trusted third parties.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, some level of assurance 
        in software can be gained by looking at the past vulnerabilities discovered 
        in different Web server software. The number of past vulnerabilities is 
        an indicator of future vulnerabilities and also reflects how well the 
        software was crafted. Trustworthiness is directly related to the quality 
        of the software product. A poorly crafted product built explicitly to 
        meet security needs remains a poorly crafted product and therefore not 
        trustworthy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, some companies specialize 
        in creating very secure Web server software and some boast that no vulnerabilities 
        have ever been discovered. Users have to balance vendor's security claims 
        against any security-performance tradeoffs that have been made.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A third way to gain a level 
        of assurance in software is to use evaluated and validated software. Many 
        private-sector organizations perform third-party evaluations of commercial 
        products in order to verify a particular level of security. One of the 
        largest of these efforts is the National Information Assurance Partnership 
        (NIAP). A joint venture between NIST and NSA, NIAP has helped create an 
        international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for specifying security requirements 
        of IT products and evaluating them to that specification. It provides 
        a framework by which commercial companies can have product claims tested 
        by a third party and (if desired) obtain a certificate of validation from 
        NIAP. Various security-enhanced products are currently under evaluation, 
        including the firewalls of three major U.S. vendors. Look in the future 
        for NIAP-evaluated Web server software.</font></p>
