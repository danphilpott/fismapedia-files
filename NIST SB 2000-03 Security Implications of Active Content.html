    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By Wayne Jansen and Tom Karygiannis,<br>
      Computer Security Division,<br>
      Information Technology Laboratory,<br>
      National Institute of Standards and Technology</font></i></p>
    <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction</font></H3>
    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In today&#146;s world, both private 
      and public sectors depend upon information technology (IT) systems to perform 
      essential and mission-critical functions. Often, as technology improves 
      to provide new capabilities and features, new vulnerabilities are introduced 
      along with these functional improvements. Organizations implementing and 
      using these advanced technologies must, therefore, be increasingly on guard.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One such emerging technology 
        is <I>active content</I>. Although the term has different connotations 
        among individuals, it is used here in its broadest sense to refer to electronic 
        documents that, unlike ASCII character documents of the past, are able 
        to automatically carry out or trigger actions without the intervention 
        of a user. Examples of active content include PostScript&reg; documents, 
        Java<font size="-4"><sup>TM</sup></font> applets, JavaScript<font size="-4"><sup>TM</sup>,</font> 
        word processing and spreadsheet macros, and executable electronic mail 
        attachments. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose of this bulletin 
        is to provide an overview of this technology so that the reader is better 
        informed about the associated security risks and can make more informed 
        IT security decisions. The bulletin provides real-world examples involving 
        commonly available products and development tools as a way of increasing 
        the understanding and awareness of the potential risks involved. A glossary 
        of relevant terms and links to useful online references are also included 
        at the end of this publication.</font> </P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having the ability to download 
        files and electronic documents off the Internet is a useful function and 
        a common practice for many people today. While there are risks involved 
        if one visits an unknown site, it appears at first glance that there should 
        be no harm in downloading information as long as the files are non-executables. 
        Even if a browser plug-in or utility is downloaded, it is recognized as 
        such and must be explicitly installed in order to function, so careful 
        judgment and appropriate preparation can be taken in advance. This view 
        on risks, however, is incorrect. Today, electronic documents are themselves 
        programs or contain programs that can be self-triggered. Loading a document 
        into a word processor can produce the same effect as executing a program, 
        requiring appropriate caution to be taken. After all, if you would not 
        knowingly execute a program from an unknown source, why would you indirectly 
        execute one embedded in an electronic document?</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In striving to offer greater 
        functionality and flexibility, software developers will continue to blur 
        the distinctions between program and data. While the developer&#146;s 
        intentions are presumably good, they can often have a negative impact 
        when the need for security is not fully taken into account. Such documents 
        are said to have active content, which involves new technology such as 
        built-in macros, scripting languages, and virtual machines. The trend 
        towards active content has been spurred by the popularity of the Web. 
        A dynamic weather map, a stock ticker, and live camera views or programmed 
        broadcasts appearing on a Web page are common examples of how this technology 
        is being applied. Like any technology, active content can provide a useful 
        capability, but can also become a source of vulnerability for an attacker 
        to exploit. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Active content can be considered 
        to be a form of mobile code, whereby the code in the form of a script, 
        macro, or other portable representation can move either indirectly (e.g., 
        via an electronic mail attachment) or directly (e.g., via a Web page) 
        from one platform to another where it eventually executes. Because the 
        technology is designed to be seamless, a user is often unaware of what 
        is happening. The problem with mobile code in general, and active content 
        in particular, is that it can embed a Trojan horse or other form of malicious 
        code into a system.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prevalence of unintentional 
        implementation errors in software applications that process electronic 
        documents plagues active content technology. Even if a design is correct 
        and secure, the implementation may unintentionally contain a serious vulnerability 
        that can be exploited by malicious code conveyed in the active content 
        portion of a document. Together, active content and implementation errors 
        can damage or subvert an IT system. An attacker needs only to learn what 
        software their target is using, find an appropriate exploit, and send 
        the document to the target.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The trend in application software 
        development is to add more features and greater complexity to products. 
        Complexity begets more code, more code interacts with other code and, 
        hence, more implementation errors occur. This trend, combined with the 
        competitive pressures facing manufacturers to be first to the market, 
        the technical and cost barriers to extensive testing, and a marketplace 
        that chooses functionality over security, ensures attackers continual 
        opportunities in the future.</font></P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Technology-Related Risks</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some popular active-content technologies 
        are described below. They are provided as present-day examples and do 
        not imply an endorsement of the technology or product by NIST. A number 
        of them share the characteristic of providing a useful capability when 
        used in a Web browser environment. However, an attacker can exploit them. 
        The motivation for these technologies is to improve functionality and 
        gain flexibility for the user. In a Web application, this involves moving 
        code processing away from the Web server onto the client&#146;s Web browser. 
        Allowing remote systems to run arbitrary code on a local system, however, 
        poses serious security risks. Traditional client-server systems do not 
        involve such risks since they rely on static code on both the server and 
        client sides.</font> </P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PostScript&reg;</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the earliest examples 
        of active content is PostScript&reg; document representation, still in 
        wide use today. PostScript&reg; is a page description language that is 
        widely used on most computer platforms. It is the de facto standard in 
        commercial typesetting and printing houses. PostScript&reg; commands are 
        language statements in ASCII text that are translated into the printer's 
        machine language by a PostScript&reg; interpreter built into the printer. 
        The interpreter uses scalable fonts, eliminating the need to store a variety 
        of font sizes. A PostScript&reg; file contains a document description, 
        which is specified in the PostScript&reg; page description language. The 
        language is a powerful interpreted language, comparable to many programming 
        languages, and, therefore, PostScript&reg; documents inherently convey 
        active content. For example, the language defines primitives for file 
        manipulation, which can be used in a PostScript&reg; document to modify 
        arbitrary files when the document is displayed or printed. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An early exploit of PostScript&reg; 
        technology involved the language's ability to set a password held by the 
        interpreter. In some hardware implementations of the language interpreter, 
        if the password was set, it remained in non-volatile memory and prevented 
        subsequent documents from being printed unless they contained the same 
        password. An attacker sending a password-setting document could disable 
        the printer in this way, requiring hardware replacement to rectify the 
        situation. Some PostScript&reg; interpreters can be set to disable potentially 
        harmful primitives, but such actions can also inhibit useful functions. 
        This dilemma is a recurring theme with active content.</font></P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Java<font size="-4"><sup>TM</sup></font></font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Java is a full-featured programming 
        language compiled into platform-independent byte code that is executed 
        by an interpreter called the Java<font size="-4"><sup>TM</sup></font> 
        Virtual Machine. The resulting byte code can be executed where compiled 
        or transferred to another Java-enabled platform (e.g., conveyed via an 
        HTML Web page as an applet). Java is useful for adding functionality to 
        Web sites and many services offered by various popular Web sites require 
        the user to have a Java-enabled browser. The developers of Java tried 
        to address the problem of security and were successful to a large extent. 
        Java code is confined to a <I>sandbox</I> that restricts the access of 
        the code to computational resources based on its permissions. Permissions 
        are assigned primarily based on the source of the code (where it came 
        from) and the author of the code (who developed it).</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Java sandbox is designed 
        to prevent Web applets from inspecting or changing files on a client file 
        system and using network connections to circumvent file protections or 
        people's expectations of privacy. Hostile applets, however, still pose 
        security threats even while executing within the sandbox. A hostile applet 
        can consume or exploit system resources in an inappropriate manner or 
        cause a user to perform an undesired or unwanted action. Examples of hostile 
        applets exploits include denial-of-service, mail forging, invasion of 
        privacy (e.g., exporting of identity, electronic mail address, and platform 
        information) and installing backdoors to the system. The Java security 
        model is fairly complex and can be difficult for a user to understand 
        and manage, which can increase risk. Moreover, many implementation bugs 
        have also been found, which allow one to bypass security mechanisms.</font></P>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JavaScript<font size="-4"><sup>TM</sup></font>and 
        Visual Basic&reg; Script</font></h3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JavaScript is a general-purpose, 
        cross-platform scripting language whose code can be embedded within standard 
        Web pages to create interactive documents. JavaScript, which is similar 
        to Microsoft&reg; Jscript&reg;, was developed by Netscape. Both are founded 
        on the same standard, the ECMAScript Language Specification, ECMA-262. 
        The scripting language is extremely powerful and able to perform anything 
        a user can do within the context of the browser. Design and implementation 
        bugs have been discovered in both commercial scripting products. JavaScript 
        does not have methods for directly accessing a client file system or for 
        directly opening connections to other computers besides the host that 
        provided the content source.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Visual Basic&reg; Script (VBScript) 
        is a programming language developed by Microsoft&reg; for creating scripts 
        that can be embedded in Web pages for viewing with the Internet Explorer 
        browser. VBScript is a subset of the widely used Microsoft&reg; Visual 
        Basic&reg; programming language and also works with Microsoft&reg; ActiveX&reg; 
        Controls. The language is similar to JavaScript and poses similar risks.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In theory, confining a scripting 
        language to boundaries of a Web browser should provide a relatively secure 
        environment. In practice, this has not been the case. The main sources 
        of problems have been twofold: the prevalence of implementation flaws 
        and the close binding of the browser to related functionality such as 
        an electronic mail facility or the underlying operating system. Past exploits 
        include sending a user's URL history list to a remote site, and stealing 
        the mail address of the user and forging electronic mail.</font></P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ActiveX&reg;</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ActiveX&reg; is a set of technologies 
        from Microsoft&reg; that provide tools for linking desktop applications 
        to the Web. ActiveX&reg; controls are reusable component program objects 
        that can be attached to electronic mail or downloaded from a Web site. 
        ActiveX&reg; controls also come preinstalled on Windows&reg; platforms. 
        Unlike Java, which is a platform-independent programming language, ActiveX&reg; 
        controls are distributed as executable binaries and must be separately 
        compiled for each target machine and operating system.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ActiveX&reg; security model 
        is considerably different from the Java sandbox model. The Java model 
        restricts the permissions of applets to a set of safe actions. ActiveX&reg;, 
        on the other hand, places no restrictions on what a control can do. Instead, 
        ActiveX&reg; controls are digitally signed by their author under a technology 
        scheme called Authenticode. The digital signatures are verified using 
        identity certificates issued by a trusted certificate authority to an 
        ActiveX&reg; software publisher. For an ActiveX&reg; publisher's certificate 
        to be granted, the software publisher must pledge that no harmful code 
        will be knowingly distributed under this scheme. The Authenticode process 
        ensures that ActiveX&reg; controls cannot be distributed anonymously and 
        that tampering with the controls can be detected. This certification process, 
        however, does not ensure that a control will be well behaved. The ActiveX&reg; 
        security model assigns the responsibility for the computer system's security 
        to the user. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before the browser downloads 
        an unsigned ActiveX&reg; control or a control whose corresponding publisher's 
        certificate was issued by an unknown certifying authority, the browser 
        presents a dialog box warning the user that this action may not be safe. 
        Users can choose to abort the transfer or may continue the transfer if 
        they assume the source is trustworthy or they are willing to assume the 
        risk. Users may not be aware of the security implications of this decision, 
        which may result in poor decisions. Even when the user is well informed, 
        attackers may trick the user into approving the transfer. In the past, 
        attackers have exploited implementation flaws to cover the user dialogue 
        window with another that displays an unobtrusive message such as &quot;Do 
        you want to continue?&quot; while exposing the positive indication button 
        needed to launch active content. Recent versions of Internet Explorer 
        allow the user to customize the behavior of ActiveX&reg; controls depending 
        on whether they are downloaded from a site on the Internet, a site on 
        the local area network, or a site belonging to sets of identified trusted 
        and untrusted sites.</font></P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Desktop Application Macros</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Developers of popular spreadsheet, 
        word processing, and other desktop applications created macros to allow 
        users to automate and customize repetitive tasks. A macro is a series 
        of menu selections, keystrokes, and commands that have been recorded and 
        assigned a name or key combination. When the macro name is called or the 
        macro key combination is pressed, the steps in the macro are executed 
        from beginning to end. Macros are used to shorten long menu sequences 
        as well as to create miniature programs within an application. Macro languages 
        often include programming controls (IF, THEN, GOTO, WHILE, etc.) that 
        automate sequences like any programming language. A virus can be written 
        into a macro that is stored in a spreadsheet or word processing document. 
        When the document is opened, the macro is executed and the virus is activated. 
        It can also attach itself to subsequent documents that are saved with 
        the same macro. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The recent Melissa virus is 
        an example of the potential risk involved. A Microsoft&reg; Word document 
        containing a malicious Visual Basic&reg; for Applications macro propagated 
        itself through the Internet by sending the host document as an electronic 
        mail attachment addressed to contacts found in the victim&#146;s address 
        book. The newer generation of electronic mail applications, including 
        the ones built into Web browsers, allows mail attachments to contain active 
        content such as document macros or JavaScript programs. Since active content 
        provides a number of avenues for exploits, such enclosures should be opened 
        only after due consideration of the inherent risks.</font></P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plug-Ins</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plug-ins are programs that work 
        in conjunction with software applications to enhance their capabilities. 
        Plug-ins are often added to Web browsers to enable them to support new 
        types of content (audio, video, etc.). Such plug-ins can be downloaded 
        from either the browser vendor&#146;s site or from a third-party site. 
        Browsers typically prompt the user to download a new plug-in when a document 
        that requires functionality beyond the browser&#146;s current capabilities. 
        Although plug-ins allow browsers to support new types of content, they 
        are not active content in and of themselves, but simply an active-content-enabling 
        technology. Windows&reg; Media Player, RealPlayer, ThingViewer, QuickTime, 
        Shockwave, and Flash are all examples of plug-ins that allow browsers 
        to support new content types ranging from audio, video, interactive animation, 
        and other forms of &#147;new media.&#148;</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From a security standpoint, 
        plug-ins contain executable code and, therefore, precautions should be 
        exercised in obtaining and installing them, as with any other software 
        application. Downloading free software code and authorizing its installation 
        by simply clicking an &#147;Install now&#148; or equivalent button is 
        risky. Downloading plug-ins from reputable manufacturers can mitigate 
        the risk, but even in this case, it is difficult for the user to always 
        be aware of the security implications. In the past, unwanted side effects 
        such as changes to browser security settings and tracking of a user&#146;s 
        content preferences, however well intentioned, have occurred. Plug-ins 
        designed to animate cursors or hyperlinks have also been designed to better 
        track user preferences and viewing habits across a particular Web site. 
        Although these additional capabilities may improve the user's experience 
        with a particular Web site, the privacy and security implications are 
        often not readily disclosed. Even if the site has a valid identity certificate 
        associated with the signed downloaded code, this only tells the user that 
        the manufacturer of the code has been verified by a certificate authority, 
        but not whether the code obtained from them will behave non-maliciously 
        or correctly. Users of plug-ins should be cautioned to read the fine print 
        before agreeing to download executables and to take adequate measures 
        to back up their system in case there are problems.</font> </P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Countermeasures</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A number of steps can be taken 
        to mitigate the risks in using active content. The following sections 
        highlight some of the more useful countermeasures one can apply.</font></P>
      <P><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Security Policy</font></b></p>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having or establishing an organizational 
        security policy is an important first step in applying countermeasures 
        for active content. For example, an Internet security policy can address 
        enabling Java, JavaScript, or ActiveX&reg; on individual user's Web browsers 
        in various ways:</font></P>
    <UL>
        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Functionality must be disallowed 
          completely; </font></LI>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Functionality is allowed, 
          but only from internal organizational servers; </font></LI>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Functionality is allowed, 
          but only from trusted external servers; and </font></LI>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Functionality is allowed 
          from any server.</font> </LI>
    </UL>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the policy is not stated clearly 
        and consistently, and not made known throughout an organization, it creates 
        a situation ripe for exploitation.</font></P>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Application Settings</font></b></p>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The desktop applications that 
        handle documents containing active content typically have built-in controls 
        that can be used to control or prevent access. For example, both Netscape 
        and Microsoft&reg; Web browsers have an options menu that can be used 
        to select appropriate security settings regarding active content within 
        downloadable documents. Spreadsheet, word processor, and presentation 
        graphic software applications have similar controls. Even today, many 
        manufacturers deliver products with insecure default settings. Users of 
        such applications need to become familiar with the security options available 
        and use them in accordance with organizational policy.</font> </P>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automated Filters</font></b></p>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If malicious content has been 
        identified and understood, it can be detected and eliminated or rejected 
        completely from entering. For example, many firewalls are capable of filtering 
        electronic mail attachments for well-known file types, such as .exe executable 
        files, and deleting them at the point of entry. More sophisticated filters 
        can perform checks for viruses within executables and hidden macros within 
        document files. Anti-virus software has also become increasingly capable 
        of detecting electronic documents having active content with malicious 
        code</font>. </P>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Version Control</font></b></p>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Users can gain better security 
        by applying security patches when available. This is a well-known and 
        effective remedy, but for a variety of reasons, it is also an often-ignored 
        one. Users can also take advantage of security enhancements to their applications 
        by upgrading to newer versions. Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;98 users can 
        use the Windows&reg; update feature to find bug fixes and product updates 
        and download them automatically from the Web. Using this feature, however, 
        requires the user to use code that will scan the computer for installation 
        information in order to properly install any upgrades. The Microsoft&reg; 
        Web site states that none of this information is sent to Microsoft&reg; 
        or over the Internet. Updating software products automatically over the 
        Web is becoming increasingly popular, as the benefits to the user are 
        considerable. As this practice becomes more commonplace, users must be 
        better aware of the implicit decisions they make when allowing vendors 
        to run software on their machine. For example, updating an audio player 
        on a computer may allow the vendor to track the user&#146;s musical preferences.</font> 
      </P>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Readers</font></b></p>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Occasionally, manufacturers of 
        desktop applications provide free software readers, which are capable 
        of interpreting their proprietary file formats, for recipients of the 
        documents who do not own the application. The Adobe&reg; Acrobat&reg; 
        Reader, for example, allows users to view and print Portable Document 
        Format (PDF) files, but does not allow users to edit them. Since the software 
        readers are only intended to produce a readable rendition of the document 
        and are not full-fledge applications, they bypass many potentially harmful 
        features and exploits based on implementation vulnerabilities contained 
        in a specific application. Besides manufacturer-provided readers, general-purpose 
        software readers are commercially available, which are capable of rendering 
        dozens of file formats. A related measure is the selection of documents 
        with less capable formats of active content, when multiple choices are 
        offered. Some Web sites offer an electronic document in a variety of formats 
        such as native word processor format, PostScript&reg;, or PDF. While PDF 
        represents text and graphics using the imaging model of the PostScript&reg; 
        language, PDF is not a programming language and contains no language constructs, 
        making it the safest alternative.</font></P>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">System Isolation</font></b></p>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Isolation works two ways. First, 
        a production computer system that is unable to receive documents containing 
        active content is unlikely to be affected by malicious hidden code. Although 
        it is not always possible to isolate a system physically, logical isolation 
        may be applied, at least to some degree. Second, risky functions, such 
        as Web browsing, may be confined to a second system designated exclusively 
        for that purpose. Often older or spare systems are available and could 
        be put to good use this way.</font> </P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Summary</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Active-content documents offer 
        several benefits to both the users of these documents and their authors. 
        Java applets, JavaScript, and ActiveX&reg; provide additional functionality 
        to Web pages, plug-ins enable browsers to support new types of content, 
        PostScript&reg; offloads the processing and interpretation of the presentation 
        of documents to the printer, and macros automate repetitive word processing 
        and spreadsheet tasks. The benefits of each of these active-content technologies 
        must be carefully weighed against the risks they pose. Security is not 
        black or white, but shades of gray. When employing active-content technology, 
        security measures should be put in place to reduce risk to an acceptable 
        level and to recover if an incident occurs. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Informed security officers, 
        administrators, and other IT professionals are responsible for developing 
        security policies based on their organization&#146;s specific security 
        needs and level of acceptable risk. Unfortunately, there is rarely a &#147;one 
        size fits all&#148; guideline that fits the unique needs of every organization 
        and each organization must decide what constitutes an acceptable level 
        of risk. Establishing an organizational security policy is an important 
        step in developing and applying appropriate security measures. The IT 
        and security staff have a responsibility for keeping abreast of the associated 
        risks with emerging technologies by subscribing to security mailing lists 
        and visiting vendor Web sites for information and updates for products 
        used within their organization. As active content moves beyond desktop 
        personal computers to mobile handsets, television sets, and a wide variety 
        of other consumer electronic goods, users will be faced with competing 
        and difficult tradeoffs between privacy and security, with increased functionality 
        and ease-of-use. </font></P>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following definitions highlight 
        key concepts used throughout this bulletin:</font></P>
    <UL>
        <li><I><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Active Content</font></I><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">: 
          Active content refers to electronic documents that are able to automatically 
          carry out or trigger actions without the intervention of a user.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Computer Virus</I>: A 
          computer virus is similar to a Trojan horse (see below) insofar as it 
          is a program that contains hidden code, which usually performs some 
          unwanted function as a side effect. The main difference is that the 
          hidden code in a computer virus can replicate by attaching a copy of 
          itself to other programs and may also include an additional &quot;payload&quot; 
          that triggers when specific conditions are met.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Interpreter</I>: An interpreter 
          is a program that processes a script or other program expression and 
          carries out the requested action, in accordance with the language definition.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Malicious Code</I>: Malicious 
          code refers to programs that are written intentionally to carry out 
          annoying or harmful actions. They often masquerade as useful programs 
          or are embedded into useful programs, so that users are induced into 
          activating them. Types of malicious code include Trojan horses and computer 
          viruses.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Script</I>: A script 
          is a sequence of commands, often residing in an ASCII file that can 
          be interpreted and executed automatically. Unlike compiled programs, 
          which execute directly on a computer processor, a script must be processed 
          by another program that carries out the indicated action.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Scripting Language</I>: 
          A scripting language defines the syntax and semantics for writing scripts. 
          Typically, scripting languages follow the conventions of a simple programming 
          language, but they can also take on a more basic form such as a macro 
          or a batch file. JavaScript, VBScript, and Perl are examples of scripting 
          languages.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Trojan Horse</I>: A Trojan 
          horse is a useful or seemingly useful program that contains hidden code 
          of a malicious nature. When the program is invoked, so is the undesired 
          function whose effects may not become immediately obvious. The name 
          stems from an ancient exploit of invaders' gaining entry to the city 
          of Troy by concealing themselves in the body of a hollow wooden horse, 
          presumed to be left behind by the invaders as a gift to the city.</font></li>
