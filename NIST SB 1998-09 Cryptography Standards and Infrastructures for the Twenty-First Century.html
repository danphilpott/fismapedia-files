      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Internet is opening up 
        new ways for consumers, industry, and governments to conduct business 
        and to exchange information electronically. Electronic ordering and payments 
        can be handled efficiently and conveniently over the network. Electronic 
        mail and informational Web pages have become institutional resources. 
        Yet the full benefits of electronic commerce and information exchanges 
        will not be realized until users have sufficient trust and confidence 
        in the security and privacy of their information. </font> 
            <P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The President's Commission on Critical 
        Infrastructure Protection recently issued a report on the threats to telecommunications, 
        energy, banking and finance, and other systems critical to the government 
        and economy of the U.S. The Commission warned that people may not be willing 
        to use the Internet for commerce if they do not have confidence that their 
        communications and data are safe from unauthorized access or modification. 
        Further, the Commission noted that secure and reliable telecommunications 
        networks must have effective ways for authenticating information and assuring 
        the confidentiality of information. There is no single technology or technique 
        that will produce the needed security and reliability of networks. A range 
        of technologies, including cryptography, improved identification and authentication 
        technologies, and firewalls, will be required, along with trusted encryption 
        key and security management infrastructures. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cryptography has had, and will 
        continue to have, an important role in protecting information both within 
        a computer system and when information is sent over the Internet and other 
        unprotected communications channels. Cryptography serves many functions 
        in secure business transactions by providing ways to assure data confidentiality, 
        data integrity, authentication of message originator, user authentication, 
        electronic certification of data, and nonrepudiation. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This bulletin reports on the 
        progress being made by NIST and by its government and industry partners 
        to advance the development of electronic commerce systems in which users 
        will have confidence. There are efforts underway to update existing standards 
        for cryptography; to develop new and stronger forms of encryption; and 
        to create infrastructures that will support safe electronic transactions 
        in future networks. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Data Encryption Standard</B> 
        </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two basic components of 
        cryptography are the algorithm or cryptographic methodology used, and 
        the key. In modern systems, algorithms are complex mathematical formulae 
        and keys are strings of bits. The Data Encryption Standard (DES), issued 
        in 1977, provides an encryption algorithm for protecting federal unclassified 
        information from unauthorized disclosure or undetected modification during 
        transmission or while in storage. The standard is based on secret key 
        cryptography. The algorithm is publicly known; the key system is symmetric 
        with the same key used for encrypting and decrypting information, and 
        the keys must be kept secret. The standard was initially issued for government 
        use. It was subsequently adopted as a voluntary industry standard (American 
        National Standard X3.92 1981/R1987) and has been widely implemented by 
        the private sector. It is based on the work of the International Business 
        Machines Corporation. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under the provisions of the 
        DES, NIST is required to conduct a review every five years to determine 
        whether the cryptographic algorithm specified by the standard should be 
        affirmed, revised, or withdrawn. The first review resulted in the reaffirmation 
        of the standard in 1983; the standard was again reaffirmed in 1988 following 
        a second review; as a result of the third review, which was completed 
        in 1993, the DES was reaffirmed for use through 1998 as <I>Federal Information 
        Processing Standard (FIPS) 46-2.</I> </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Triple DES.</B> A more secure 
        method for using the DES algorithm in three operations, called Triple 
        DES, has been developed by the private sector. Triple Data Encryption 
        Algorithm mode of operations and implementation methods have been documented 
        and specified as draft American National Standards (X9.52 and X9.65) by 
        Accredited Standards Committee X9 for Financial Services. This committee 
        develops cryptography and public key infrastructure standards for the 
        banking community. Federal organizations that need security beyond that 
        provided by the DES can use these standards. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Strength of the DES.</B> 
        The continued security of the DES has been questioned as the result of 
        various attempts to break the algorithm. The security provided by DES 
        cryptographic systems depends on the mathematical soundness of the algorithm, 
        length of the keys, key management, mode of operation, and implementation. 
        It is expected that people will continue to try to attack the DES, and 
        other encryption algorithms as well. Successful attacks on the DES have 
        been brute force attacks, which have tried all possible keys for a given 
        encryption until the correct key is found. Motivated by a well-publicized 
        competition in 1997, successful attackers organized teams of people and 
        tens of thousands of computers that worked for months to break one message. 
        In July 1998, the New York Times reported that a group of computer experts 
        had succeeded in breaking a DES-encoded message by building a cracking 
        machine costing $250,000. The machine, consisting of 27 boards each holding 
        64 chips, took 56 hours to recover a DES key and decipher an encrypted 
        message. This most recent attack appears to demonstrate that a single 
        determined attacker can develop an effective DES cracking machine. In 
        some cases, the attack may not pose an immediate or significant threat. 
        However, organizations may wish to consider making the transition to the 
        use of Triple DES, matching the strength of the protective measures against 
        the associated risks. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In consultation with other 
        organizations, NIST is developing plans for its next steps concerning 
        the DES. One option under consideration is to revise the applicability 
        provisions of the standard to recommend that agencies use multiple DES 
        iterations, such as Triple DES, to protect highly sensitive data and data 
        that requires long-term protection for confidentiality. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Escrowed Encryption Standard</B> 
        </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>FIPS 185, Escrowed Encryption 
        Standard</I>, specifies the SKIPJACK algorithm which federal agencies 
        can use for protecting the confidentiality of data. When originally issued, 
        the SKIPJACK algorithm and the Key Exchange Algorithm used with SKIPJACK 
        were classified secret. Recently, the Department of Defense announced 
        that it had declassified both algorithms in an effort to encourage the 
        development of reasonably priced and interoperable computer protection 
        products for the Defense Message System and other Department of Defense 
        applications. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Review of <I>FIPS 140-1, 
        Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules</I></B> </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Issued in 1994, FIPS 140-1 
        specifies the overall requirements for the design and implementation of 
        modules that use cryptographic algorithms and methods. The standard identifies 
        requirements for four security levels for cryptographic modules to provide 
        for different sensitivity levels of data from low value to high value, 
        and for many different applications. Like the DES, this standard also 
        calls for a review by NIST every five years. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first planned review of 
        FIPS 140-1 will be announced in the <I>Federal Register</I> later this 
        year. Public comments will be solicited on the continued usefulness of 
        the standard and on any requirements for revisions that may be needed 
        to meet the challenges of technological and economic change. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NIST has established a program 
        to validate cryptographic modules for correct implementation of cryptography 
        standards. This effort is carried out under the auspices of the National 
        Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), and in cooperation 
        with the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of the Government 
        of Canada. A list of validated products is maintained by NIST and is available 
        on the Web site listed at the end of this bulletin. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Expansion of the Digital 
        Signature Standard</B> </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public key cryptography uses 
        two keys: a private key and a public key. The private key cannot be derived 
        from the public key. FIPS 186, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), specifies 
        the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), that is used in conjunction with 
        FIPS 180-1, Secure Hash Algorithm, for applications requiring the authentication 
        of data integrity and the identity of the signer. FIPS 186 provides cryptographic 
        techniques based on public key cryptography for generating and verifying 
        electronic signatures, which can be used to verify the origin and contents 
        of a message. FIPS 180-1 specifies a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) which 
        can be used to generate a condensed representation of a message called 
        a message digest. These techniques, that were developed for the federal 
        government, are also implemented in commercial products and used by both 
        the public and private sectors. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last year, NIST proposed expanding 
        the Digital Signature Standard to include additional signature algorithms 
        that the federal government could endorse to authenticate electronic information 
        and transactions and to assure high levels of integrity. Most of the federal 
        organizations responding to our request for comments supported the addition 
        of alternative signature algorithms. We have identified RSA and Elliptic 
        Curve Cryptography technology as potential new algorithms for inclusion 
        in a revised FIPS 186. Both techniques have been proposed as voluntary 
        industry standards. Seeking to be consistent with the actions in the voluntary 
        standards community, we are awaiting the completion of the industry standardization 
        processes before proceeding with the revision of the FIPS to include the 
        RSA technique and Elliptic Curve Cryptography technology. When approved 
        by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as voluntary industry 
        standards, we intend to take appropriate steps to gain approval and to 
        advise federal agencies that they can use these standards in addition 
        to the DSA. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Development of the Advanced 
        Encryption Standard</B> </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Last year, we also announced 
        that we would begin a multi-year project to develop an Advanced Encryption 
        Standard (AES) which would provide cryptographic protection for data well 
        into the next century. Planned as a government and industry cooperative 
        effort, the AES project has elicited considerable public attention and 
        involvement. More than fifty public comments were received on the minimum 
        acceptability requirements and the criteria that were drafted to evaluate 
        candidate algorithms for the AES. More than 75 individuals from industry 
        and government agencies attended a workshop held in April 1997 to refine 
        the requirements and criteria. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A call for candidate algorithms 
        based on the jointly developed requirements and criteria was announced 
        in the <I>Federal Register</I> (September 12, 1997, Volume 62, Number 
        177, Pages 48051-48058). By the submission deadline of June 15, 1998, 
        we had received 21 submissions, including many from U.S. industry. Fifteen 
        of these met NIST's submission requirements and minimum acceptability 
        criteria. The fifteen candidate algorithms were announced at a conference 
        held in Ventura, California, on August 20-22, 1998. We plan to work with 
        the cryptographic research community in evaluating the candidate proposals. 
        After reviews and tests of implementations for efficiency, we will narrow 
        the candidate proposals to approximately five, and invite further review 
        and analysis. The AES is planned to be an unclassified, publicly disclosed 
        symmetric key encryption algorithm that will be available royalty-free 
        worldwide. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Key Agreement or Exchange</B> 
        </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cryptographic services depend 
        on the secure generation and distribution of keys (public and private). 
        Key management services are needed to support authentication, integrity, 
        and confidentiality of information. NIST has solicited comments on technologies 
        that could be considered for the design and implementation of federal 
        key agreement and exchange systems for public key-based cryptography. 
        Key exchange technologies under consideration are RSA, Elliptic Curve, 
        and Diffie-Hellman technologies to give federal organizations broad flexibility 
        in using cryptographic systems. We will await the completion of the voluntary 
        standards processes before proposing a federal standard for key agreement 
        and exchange. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Public Key Infrastructure 
        (PKI)</B> </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several activities are underway 
        to support the development of a public key infrastructure which provides 
        the means to bind the public keys used in cryptographic functions to their 
        owners and to distribute keys in large heterogeneous networks. The use 
        of PKI technology can help to increase confidence in electronic transactions 
        and allow parties without prior knowledge of each other to conduct verifiable 
        transactions. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>PKI Pilots.</B> NIST is 
        working with the Federal PKI Steering Committee (a committee established 
        by the Government Information Technology Services [GITS] Board) to promote 
        the consideration and use of public key technology by federal agencies 
        in the performance of intra-agency and interagency business and in transactions 
        with trading partners and the public. Established under Executive Order 
        13011, GITS is conducting demonstration projects, pilots, and proof-of-concept 
        projects in support of the Administration's National Partnership for Reinventing 
        Government (formerly the National Performance Review) initiative to make 
        government work better and cost less by reengineering through information 
        technology. NIST also works with industry groups including the Internet 
        Engineering Task Force PKIX Working Group and the Accredited Standards 
        Committee X9. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Interoperability Specifications.</B> 
        In conjunction with ten research partners under a cooperative research 
        and development agreement (CRADA), NIST completed a Minimum Interoperability 
        Specification for Public Key Infrastructure Components (MISPC). Based 
        on analysis of implementations of PKI components provided by the CRADA 
        participants, the specification provides a minimal set of features, transactions, 
        and data formats for various certificate management components that make 
        up a PKI. The MISPC can be used by industry and government organizations 
        in acquiring PKI components and services. NIST is developing a laboratory-based 
        reference implementation of the MISPC as a proof of concept and to enable 
        developers of PKI systems to test their implementations. Future laboratory 
        work will be directed toward developing a test suite to provide the means 
        for the validation of the interoperability of PKI systems. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PKI product developers are 
        beginning to incorporate parts of the MISPC into their products. This 
        is the start of the development of secure, interoperable PKI implementations 
        that will provide security services for confidentiality and digital signatures 
        and enable secure electronic business transactions. Under a second CRADA 
        with 16 industry partners, we are expanding the MISPC to incorporate support 
        for confidentiality components. In addition, we are defining technical 
        security requirements for PKI components. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Key Recovery</B> </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NIST is exploring the use of 
        key recovery technology through a broad agency announcement for several 
        agency pilot projects and with the help of a technical advisory committee. 
        An announcement in the <I>Commerce Business Daily</I> last year solicited 
        proposals for products and services that will demonstrate the viability 
        of an infrastructure for key recovery. NIST has participated in a Key 
        Recovery Demonstration Project involving several government agencies to 
        demonstrate techniques to recover keys used in data encryption and to 
        identify, test, and evaluate different key recovery products and services. 
        Planned laboratory work includes development of conformance tests and 
        techniques for integrating key recovery components into larger functional 
        systems. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This effort supports the Administration's 
        policies on privacy, commerce, security, and public safety in the Global 
        Information Infrastructure. Concerned about potential harm to law enforcement 
        and national security from the use of unrecoverable encryption, the Administration 
        backs the development of a key management infrastructure to protect U.S. 
        national security, foreign policy, and law enforcement interests. A technical 
        advisory committee to develop a FIPS for the federal key management infrastructure 
        has been established to provide industry advice on encryption key recovery 
        techniques for use by federal government agencies. The Committee currently 
        includes 20 industry members. The Committee has developed a draft key 
        recovery model and specifications for the security and functionality of 
        key recovery components. The draft specifications are available to industry 
        organizations that wish to develop products that meet customer requirements 
        for key recovery. The specifications are available for review at the Web 
        site listed at the end of this bulletin. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Export Controls on Cryptography</B> 
        </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Administration has announced 
        changes to the export control rules for encryption items on the U.S. Munitions 
        List. Except for those items specifically designed, developed, configured, 
        adapted, or modified for military applications, control of the export 
        of encryption items has been transferred to the Department of Commerce. 
        One of the options allowed under the revised rules is the export and re-export 
        of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent 
        strength after a one-time review of the strength of the item and if the 
        exporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and/or market recoverable 
        encryption items, to support an international key management infrastructure. 
        This policy applies to hardware and software and will last through December 
        31, 1998. Many U.S. vendors are planning key recovery products as part 
        of the licensing provisions under the Department of Commerce's export 
        control regulations. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Department of Commerce 
        continues to review the export control policies and recently announced 
        that it had completed guidelines to allow the export of U.S.-manufactured 
        encryption products of any bit-length when used by banks, financial institutions, 
        and their branches around the world to secure private electronic transactions. 
        The new guidelines will allow for the export of strong encryption products, 
        with or without recovery features, to eligible institutions without a 
        license, after a one-time review. Eligible institutions include banks, 
        security firms, brokers, and credit card companies in 45 countries. The 
        45 eligible countries are either members of the international anti-money 
        laundering accord, the Financial Action Task Force, or have enacted anti-money 
        laundering laws. </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Summary</B> </font>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the use of information technology 
        expands rapidly, the need for advanced cryptography and high-quality security 
        techniques and services increases. NIST is working with government and 
        industry organizations to make cryptography and security services available 
        for all to use in exploiting fully the benefits of the Internet. </font>
