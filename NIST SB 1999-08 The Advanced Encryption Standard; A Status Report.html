      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NIST's Information Technology 
        Laboratory is working with industry and the cryptographic community to 
        develop an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The goal is to develop 
        a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) that specifies an encryption 
        algorithm(s) capable of protecting sensitive (unclassified) government 
        information well into the next century. The algorithm(s) is expected to 
        be used by the U.S. Government and, on a voluntary basis, by the private 
        sector. This ITL Bulletin gives a status report on the development of 
        the AES, summarizes the evaluation process, and briefly describes the 
        five finalist algorithms selected in Round 1 of the AES development process.</font></p>
      <p> <B><font size="+1" color="#000099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Background</font></B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
        On January 2, 1997, NIST announced the initiation of an effort to develop 
        the AES and made a formal call for algorithms on September 12, 1997. The 
        call stipulated that the AES must specify an unclassified, publicly disclosed 
        encryption algorithm(s), available royalty-free, worldwide. In addition, 
        the algorithm(s) would implement symmetric key cryptography as a block 
        cipher and (at a minimum) support a block size of 128-bits and key sizes 
        of 128-, 192-, and 256-bits.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> On August 20, 1998, NIST announced 
        its acceptance of fifteen AES candidate algorithms at the First AES Candidate 
        Conference (AES1). These algorithms had been submitted by members of the 
        cryptographic community from around the world. At that conference and 
        in a published <I>Federal Register</I> notice, NIST solicited public comments 
        on the candidates. A Second AES Candidate Conference (AES2) was held in 
        March 1999 to discuss the results of the analysis conducted by the global 
        cryptographic community on the candidate algorithms. The public comment 
        period on the initial review of the algorithms closed on April 15, 1999.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">Evaluation 
        Criteria</FONT></B><BR>
        In the call for candidate algorithms, NIST specified the evaluation criteria 
        that would be used to compare the candidate algorithms. These criteria 
        were developed from public comments to the proposed criteria and from 
        the discussions at a public AES workshop held on April 15, 1997, at NIST. 
        The evaluation criteria are divided into three major categories: Security, 
        Cost, and Algorithm and Implementation Characteristics.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I><B>Security</B></I> is 
        the most important factor in the evaluation. Security encompasses features 
        such as resistance of the algorithm to cryptanalysis, soundness of its 
        mathematical basis, randomness of the algorithm output, and relative security 
        as compared to other candidates.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I><B>Cost</B></I> is a second 
        important area of evaluation that encompasses licensing requirements, 
        computational efficiency (speed) on various platforms, and memory requirements. 
        Since one of NIST's goals is that the final AES algorithm(s) be available 
        worldwide on a royalty-free basis, intellectual property claims and potential 
        conflicts must be considered in the selection process. The speed of the 
        algorithms on a variety of platforms must also be considered. During Round 
        1, the focus was primarily on the speed associated with 128-bit keys. 
        Additionally, memory requirements and constraints for software implementations 
        of the candidates are important considerations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The third area of evaluation 
        is <I><B>algorithm and implementation characteristics</B></I> such as 
        flexibility, hardware and software suitability, and algorithm simplicity. 
        Flexibility includes the ability of an algorithm:</font></p>
      <UL TYPE="SQUARE">
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> to handle key and block 
          sizes beyond the minimum that must be supported, </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> to be implemented securely 
          and efficiently in many different types of environments, and </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> to be implemented as a 
          stream cipher, hashing algorithm, and to provide additional cryptographic 
          services. </font>
      </UL>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It must be feasible to implement 
        an algorithm in both hardware and software, and efficient firmware implementations 
        are advantageous. The relative simplicity of an algorithm's design is 
        also an evaluation factor.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">Results 
        from Round 1</FONT></B><BR>
        The Round 1 public review extended from the official announcement of the 
        fifteen AES candidates on August 20, 1998, at AES1 until the official 
        close of the comment period on April 15, 1999. During Round 1, many members 
        of the global cryptographic community supported the AES development effort 
        by analyzing and testing the fifteen AES candidates.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> NIST facilitated and focused 
        the discussion of the candidate algorithms by providing an electronic 
        discussion forum that was used to comment on the candidates, discuss relevant 
        AES issues, inform the public of new analysis results, etc. The AES home 
        page <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/aes">http://www.nist.gov/aes</A> has 
        served as a tool to disseminate information such as papers for AES2 and 
        other Round 1 public comments.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Twenty-eight papers were submitted 
        to NIST for consideration for AES2. Twenty-one of those papers were presented 
        at AES2 as part of the formal program, and several of the remaining seven 
        were also presented during an informal session at that conference. All 
        of the submitted papers were posted on the AES home page several weeks 
        prior to AES2 in order to promote informed discussions at the conference.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> AES2 gave members of the global 
        cryptographic community a chance to present and discuss the analysis that 
        had been performed on the AES candidates during Round 1, as well as other 
        important topics relevant to the AES development effort. In addition to 
        the AES2 papers, NIST received fifty-six sets of public comments on the 
        candidate algorithms during Round 1. All of these comments were made publicly 
        available on the AES home page on April 19, 1999.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> NIST performed an analysis 
        of mathematically optimized ANSI C and Java<FONT SIZE="-7"><SUP>(TM)</SUP></FONT> 
        implementations<A HREF="#ASK"><FONT COLOR="#000099"><B>*</B></FONT></A> 
        of the candidate algorithms that were provided by the submitters prior 
        to the beginning of Round 1. Additionally, NIST performed extensive statistical 
        testing on all of the candidates. The testing of ANSI C implementations 
        focused on the speed of all fifteen candidates on various desktop systems, 
        using different combinations of processors, operating systems, and compilers. 
        The submitters' Java(<FONT COLOR="#000099"SIZE="-7"><B><SUP>TM</SUP></B></FONT>) 
        code was tested for speed and memory usage on a desktop system, and other 
        features of the code were measured as well. Statistical testing was performed 
        on all fifteen candidates to determine if the algorithms generate output 
        that is statistically indistinguishable from truly random data. Testing 
        results are available on the AES home page.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">Selection 
        Process Prior to Round 2</FONT></B><BR>
        At the conclusion of the Round 1 public review, NIST established an AES 
        technical review team to recommend algorithms for Round 2 evaluations. 
        The team was composed of NIST employees who had been engaged in reviewing 
        the algorithms, reviewing the public comments on the candidates, selecting 
        papers for AES2, conducting NIST's efficiency and randomness testing, 
        attending and presenting information at the AES conferences, and managing 
        the AES development process. The team met several times over the course 
        of two months to develop their consensus position.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> During the evaluation process, 
        the NIST team considered all comments, papers, verbal comments at conferences, 
        NIST studies, reports, and proposed modifications. The team discussed 
        each candidate relative to the announced evaluation criteria and other 
        pertinent criteria suggested during the public analysis. The review of 
        each algorithm included a methodical evaluation of the following factors:</font></p>
      <UL TYPE="SQUARE">
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> security (including any 
          known attacks or weaknesses), </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> efficiency (both speed 
          and memory usage), </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> flexibility (implementation 
          on low- and high-end smart cards; support of additional key and block 
          sizes, including whether the reference code actually supported the additional 
          key sizes; suitability for use as a pseudo-random number generator, 
          hashing algorithm, etc.; and whether or not encryption and decryption 
          were the same procedure), </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> algorithm simplicity, and 
          </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> other issues that were 
          discussed in the received public comments. </font>
      </UL>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Although it was considered, 
        the team readily agreed that it was not possible to conduct a quantitatively 
        based selection of the finalists. For example, comments were not received 
        regarding the security analysis of some candidates, whereas other algorithms 
        were reported as "broken." Since security is considered the most important 
        evaluation criteria, the AES review team made a first cut of the candidates 
        based on security, then proceeded with the other selection criteria. This 
        evaluation process resulted in the team selection of five candidates with 
        superior characteristics as finalists for Round 2 evaluation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is important to note that 
        the selection of an algorithm as a finalist does not constitute endorsement 
        by NIST of the algorithm or its security. Similarly, the non-selection 
        of an algorithm is not necessarily to be taken as a statement about the 
        algorithm's quality, security, efficiency, or other characteristics.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">Round 
        2 AES Finalists</FONT></B><BR>
        Using the analyses and comments received, NIST selected five finalist 
        algorithms: <B>MARS, RC6<FONT color="#000099" SIZE="-7"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>, 
        Rijndael, Serpent,</B> and <B>Twofish</B>. No significant security vulnerabilities 
        were found for these candidates during the Round 1 analysis, and each 
        of these algorithms constitutes potentially superior technology. Below 
        is a summary of each of the finalist candidates in alphabetical order. 
        Profiles and overall assessments for all fifteen Round 1 candidates can 
        be found in the NIST Round 1 Report (from which this summary is extracted), 
        which is available on the AES home page.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>MARS</B> incorporates its 
        "cryptographic core" into an innovative, heterogeneous overall structure. 
        It also features a variety of operations, including the technique of rotating 
        digits by a varying number of places that is determined by both the data 
        and the secret key. Consequently, while MARS performs well in general, 
        it performs particularly well on computer platforms that support its rotation 
        and multiplication operations efficiently. NIST accepted a modification 
        to MARS for Round 2 (proposed by the submitter) that should improve its 
        ability and flexibility to function in some memory-constrained environments, 
        such as low-end smart cards. MARS was submitted to the AES development 
        effort by the International Business Machines Corporation.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>RC6</B> is an algorithm 
        that is simple enough to memorize and should be easy to implement compactly 
        in both software and hardware. Its simplicity also should facilitate its 
        further security analysis in Round 2, which is assisted by the analysis 
        of its predecessor, RC5. RC6 does not use substitution tables; instead, 
        the principal engine for its security is the technique of rotating digits 
        by a varying number of places that is determined by the data. In general, 
        RC6 is fast and it is particularly fast on platforms that support its 
        rotation and multiplication operations efficiently; its key setup is also 
        fast. RC6 was submitted to the AES development effort by RSA Laboratories.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Rijndael</B> performs excellently 
        across all considered platforms. Its key setup is fast and its memory 
        requirements are low, so it also should perform well in hardware and in 
        memory-constrained environments. The straightforward design and the conservative 
        choice of operations should facilitate its further analysis, and the operations 
        should be relatively easy to defend against certain attacks on physical 
        implementations. Even though parallel processing was not considered during 
        the Round 1 selection process by the AES review team, Rijndael has the 
        potential of benefiting from advances in computer processors that allow 
        many instructions to be executed in parallel. Rijndael was submitted to 
        the AES development effort by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Serpent</B> is ultra-conservative 
        in its security margin; the designers chose to use twice as many iterations 
        as they believed secure against currently known attacks. Consequently, 
        Serpent's performance is relatively slow compared to the other four finalists. 
        In some settings, however, this should be mitigated by the efficiency 
        of optimized implementations using what the submitters call the "bitslice" 
        mode, for which the algorithm was specially designed. Serpent should fit 
        well in hardware (with potential tradeoffs of speed versus space) and 
        in memory-constrained environments. The straightforward design and the 
        conservative choice of operations should facilitate further analysis of 
        this candidate, and the operations should be easy to defend against certain 
        attacks on physical implementations. Serpent was submitted to the AES 
        development effort by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Twofish</B> exhibits fast 
        and versatile performance across most platforms; it also should perform 
        well both in hardware and in memory-constrained environments. It features 
        variable substitution "tables" that depend on the secret key. The submitters 
        believe that such tables generally offer greater security than tables 
        with fixed values. The possibility of pre-computing these tables to varying 
        degrees helps Twofish offer a wide variety of performance tradeoffs. Depending 
        on the setting, Twofish can be optimized for speed, key setup, memory, 
        code size in software, or space in hardware. Twofish was submitted to 
        the AES development effort by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, 
        David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson.</font></p>

        With the announcement of the finalists, NIST formally opens the "Round 
        2" public evaluation process and solicits comments on the remaining algorithms 
        through May 15, 2000. Comments can be submitted via the AES home page. 
        NIST actively seeks comments and analysis on any aspect of the candidate 
        algorithms, including but not limited to the following topics:</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> NIST is providing an opportunity 
        for the sponsors of the AES finalists to revise the ANSI C and Java(<FONT COLOR="#000099" SIZE="-7"><B><SUP>TM</SUP></B></FONT>) 
        implementations of their algorithms. NIST intends to make these implementations 
        available (via CD-ROM) within two months of the beginning of Round 2.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Near the end of Round 2, NIST 
        will sponsor the Third AES Candidate Conference (AES3), an open, public 
        forum for discussion of the analyses of the AES finalists. Submitters 
        of the AES finalists will be invited to attend and engage in discussions 
        regarding comments on their algorithms. AES3 will be held April 13-14, 
        2000, in New York, New York. Registration and logistical information will 
        be posted on the AES home page. Proposed papers for this conference are 
        due to NIST by January 15, 2000.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Following the close of the 
        Round 2 public analysis period on May 15, 2000, NIST intends to study 
        all available information and propose the AES, which will incorporate 
        one or more AES algorithms selected from the finalists. The AES will be 
        announced as a proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 
        that will be published for public review and comment. Following the comment 
        period, the standard will be revised, as appropriate, by NIST in response 
        to those comments. A review, approval, and promulgation process will then 
        follow. If all steps of the AES development process proceed as planned, 
        it is anticipated that the standard will be completed by the summer of 
        2001.</font></p>
