    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This bulletin summarizes a new 
      ITL document, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-21, <I>Guideline for Implementing 
      Cryptography in the Federal Government.</I></font><I> </I></P>
    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In today's world, both private 
      and public sectors depend upon information technology systems to perform 
      essential and mission-critical functions. In the current environment of 
      increasingly open and interconnected systems and networks, network and data 
      security are essential for the optimum use of information technology. For 
      example, systems that carry out electronic financial transactions and electronic 
      commerce must be protected against unauthorized access to confidential records 
      and unauthorized modification of data<I>.</I></font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cryptography should be considered 
      for data that is sensitive or has a high value if it is vulnerable to unauthorized 
      disclosure or undetected modification during transmission or while in storage. 
      Cryptographic methods provide important functionality to protect against 
      intentional and accidental compromise and alteration of data. These methods 
      support communications security by encrypting the communication prior to 
      transmission and decrypting it at receipt. These methods also provide file 
      and data security by encrypting the data prior to placement on a storage 
      medium and decrypting it after retrieval from the storage medium.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NIST SP 800-21, <I>Guideline 
      for Implementing Cryptography in the Federal Government</I>, provides guidance 
      to federal agencies on selecting cryptographic controls to protect sensitive 
      unclassified information. The guideline focuses on federal standards documented 
      in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and the cryptographic 
      modules and algorithms that are validated against these standards. However, 
      to provide additional information, other standards organizations (e.g., 
      American National Standards Institute [ANSI] and International Organization 
      for Standardization [ISO]) are briefly discussed.</font> </P>

    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The guideline is intended for 
      federal employees who are responsible for designing systems and procuring, 
      installing, and operating security products to meet identified security 
      requirements. The document may be used by:</font></P>

      individuals with sufficient information to allow them to make informed decisions 
      about the cryptographic methods that will meet their specific needs to protect 
      the confidentiality, authentication, and integrity of data that is transmitted 
      and/or stored in a system or network.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The guideline is <B>not</B> intended

    </ul>
    <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">USES OF CRYPTOGRAPHY</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cryptography is a branch of mathematics 
        based on the transformation of data. Cryptography deals with the transformation 
        of ordinary text (plaintext) into coded form (ciphertext) by encryption 
        and the transformation of ciphertext into plaintext by decryption. Cryptography 
        relies upon two basic components: an <I>algorithm</I> (or cryptographic 
        methodology) and a <I>key</I>. The algorithm is the mathematical function 
        used for encryption or decryption, and the key is the parameter used in 
        the transformation. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two basic types of 
        cryptography: <I>secret-key </I>systems (also called symmetric systems) 
        and <I>public-key </I>systems (also called asymmetric systems). In secret-key 
        systems, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. That 
        is, all parties participating in the communication share a single key. 
        In public-key systems, there are two keys: a <I>public</I> key and a <I>private</I> 
        key. The public key used for encryption is different from the private 
        key used for decryption. The two keys are mathematically related, but 
        the private key cannot be determined from the public key.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In general, cryptography is 
        used to meet the following security objectives: </font> </P>
    <ul>
        <li><I><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Confidentiality</font></I><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          services restrict access to sensitive data to only those individuals 
          who are authorized to view the data. Confidentiality measures prevent 
          the <I>unauthorized</I> disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals 
          or processes.<br>
          &nbsp;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Data integrity</I> services 
          address the unauthorized or accidental modification of data. This includes 
          data insertion, deletion, and modification. To ensure data integrity, 
          a system must be able to detect <I>unauthorized</I> data modification. 
          The goal is for the receiver of the data to verify that the data has 
          not been altered.<br>
          &nbsp;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Authentication</I> services 
          establish the validity of a transmission, message, or an originator. 
          (Authentication services also verify an individual's authorization to 
          receive specific categories of information. These services are not specific 
          to cryptography.) Therefore, this service applies to both individuals 
          and the information itself. The goal is for the receiver of the data 
          to determine its origin.<br>
          &nbsp;</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>Non-repudiation</I> services 
          prevent an individual from denying that previous actions had been performed. 
          The goal is to ensure that the recipient of the data is assured of the 
          sender's identity</font>. </li> 
    </ul>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">STANDARDS AND CRITERIA</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Standards contain consistent 
        technical specifications or other criteria to be used as rules or guidelines 
        to ensure that products, processes, and services are appropriate for their 
        stated purpose. Under the Information Technology Management Reform Act 
        of 1996 and the Computer Security Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-235), the 
        National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for 
        developing technical standards and guidelines for the security and privacy 
        of federal information resources. Some of the standards and guidelines 
        used to protect sensitive information are issued by NIST as Federal Information 
        Processing Standards (FIPS). Federal agencies must comply with all standards 
        made mandatory and binding by the Secretary of Commerce.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Technically, the Secretary 
        of Commerce has authority to establish standards only for the federal 
        government. However, since FIPS are established through a public process, 
        the public is aware of their existence, and industry often uses conformance 
        to applicable NIST standards as a factor when purchasing products. Also, 
        NIST has a long history of participation in industry standards groups, 
        including ANSI, ISO, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 
        (IEEE), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and others. In some 
        cases, the federal government adopts industry standards (ANSI X9.17, <I>Key 
        Management,</I> was adopted with restrictions as FIPS 171), and industry 
        has adopted FIPS (e.g., Data Encryption Standard (DES) and DES Modes were 
        adopted by ANSI).</font></P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Benefits of Standards</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Standards are important because 
        they define common practices, methods, and measures/metrics. Therefore, 
        standards increase the reliability and effectiveness of products and ensure 
        that the products are produced with a degree of quality. Standards provide 
        solutions that have been accepted by a wide community and evaluated by 
        experts in relevant areas. By using standards, organizations can reduce 
        costs and protect their investments in technology.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Standards provide for information 
        technology (IT) interoperability, security, and integrity, and other benefits:</font></P>

          Products developed to a specific standard may be used to help support 
          interoperability with other products that conform to the same standard. 
          By using the same cryptographic algorithm, data that was encrypted using 
          vendor A's product may be decrypted using vendor B's product. The use 
          of a common standards-based cryptographic algorithm is necessary, but 
          may not be sufficient to ensure product interoperability. Other common 
          standards, such as communications protocol standards, may also be necessary. 
          By ensuring interoperability among different vendors' equipment, standards 
          permit an organization to select from various available products to 
          find the most cost-effective solution.</font><br>

          has been developed, the algorithm has been tested against this standard, 
          and the results validated by NIST. NIST validation means the algorithm 
          has been found to be adequate for the protection of sensitive government 
          data. In addition, most FIPS-approved algorithms have gone through a

        of efforts to develop criteria for evaluation of IT security. These criteria 
        will be used throughout the international community. The CC defines a 
        set of IT requirements of known validity that can be used in establishing 
        security requirements for prospective products and systems. The CC also 
        defines the Protection Profile (PP) construct that allows prospective 
        consumers or developers to create standardized sets of security requirements 
        that will meet their needs. The CC presents requirements for the IT security 
        of a product under the distinct categories of functional requirements

        standard used to describe the security properties (functional and assurance) 
        of IT products (or classes of products) and systems. In essence, the CC 
        is a standard security specification &quot;language.&quot; Products whose 
        security properties have been specified using the CC may then be validated 
        (tested) for conformance to their CC specifications. Such a validation, 
        when performed by an accredited testing laboratory, confirms that the

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are many issues that are 
        applicable to the implementation of security methods/products. These are 
        extensively discussed in other documents such as NIST SP 800-12, <I>An 
        Introduction to Computer Security: The NIST Handbook</I>; NIST SP 800-14, 
        <I>Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Security Information 
        Technology System</I>; and OMB Circular A-130, <I>Security of Federal 
        Automated Information Resources</I>, Appendix III. Of particular relevance 
        are the sections on training, contingency planning, assignment of roles 
        and responsibilities, and security violation reporting and response.</font> 
      </P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hardware vs. Software Solutions</font> 
      </H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tradeoffs among security, 
        cost, simplicity, efficiency, and ease of implementation need to be evaluated. 
        Cryptography can be implemented in hardware, software, and/or firmware; 
        each has its related costs and benefits. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Historically, software has 
        been less expensive and slower than hardware, although for large applications, 
        hardware may be less expensive. In addition, software is easier to modify 
        or bypass than equivalent hardware products. The advantages of software 
        solutions are flexibility and portability, ease of use, and ease of upgrade.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In many cases, cryptography 
        is implemented in a hardware device but is controlled by software; therefore, 
        a hybrid solution is provided. Again, the user must evaluate the solutions 
        against requirements to determine the best solution.</font></P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Public- vs. Secret-Key Cryptography</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary advantage of public-key 
        cryptography is increased security and convenience; private keys never 
        need to be transmitted or revealed to anyone. In a secret-key system, 
        the secret keys must be transmitted, either manually or through a communication 
        channel. There may be a chance that an unauthorized individual can access 
        the secret keys during their transmission.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary advantage of secret-key 
        cryptography is speed. There are popular secret-key encryption methods 
        that are significantly faster than any currently available public-key 
        encryption method. Alternatively, public-key cryptography can be used 
        with secret-key cryptography to get the best of both worlds, the security 
        advantages of public-key systems and the speed advantages of secret-key 
        systems. The public-key system can be used to encrypt a secret key that 
        is used to encrypt the bulk of a file or message. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In some situations, public-key 
        cryptography is not necessary and secret-key cryptography alone is sufficient. 
        This includes environments where secure secret-key agreement can take 
        place, environments where a single authority knows and manages all the 
        keys, and a single-user environment. In general, public-key cryptography 
        is best suited for an open multi-user environment.</font></P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Key Management</font></H3>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proper management of cryptographic 
        keys is essential to the effective use of cryptography for security. Ultimately, 
        the security of information protected by cryptography depends directly 
        on the protection afforded the keys. All keys need to be protected against 
        modification, and secret and private keys need to be protected against 
        unauthorized disclosure. Listed below are recommendations for effective 
        key management.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- <I>Ensure that users are 
        aware of their liabilities and responsibilities, and that they understand 
        the importance of keeping their keys secure.</I></font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The security of cryptographic 
        keys in an electronic or digital signature system is the foundation of 
        a secure system; therefore, users must maintain control of their keys! 
        Users must be provided with a list of responsibilities and liabilities, 
        and each user should sign a statement acknowledging these concerns before 
        receiving a key (if it is a long-term, user-controlled key). If different 
        user roles (e.g., security officer, regular user) are implemented in a 
        system, users should be aware of their unique responsibilities, especially 
        regarding the significance of a key compromise or loss.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>- Prepare for the possibility 
        of compromise.</I></font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is imperative to have a 
        plan for handling the compromise or suspected compromise of central/root 
        keys or key components at a central site; this should be established before 
        the system goes &quot;live.&quot; The contingency plan should address 
        what actions should be taken with system software and hardware, central/root 
        keys, user keys, previously generated signatures, encrypted data, etc.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If someone's private key is 
        lost or compromised, others must be made aware of this, so that they will 
        no longer encrypt messages using the invalid public key nor accept messages 
        signed with the invalid private key. Users must be able to store their 
        private keys securely, so that no intruder can find them, yet the keys 
        must be readily accessible for legitimate use. Keys need to be valid only 
        until a specified expiration date.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>- Sign and verify the code 
        that implements the cryptographic functions.</I></font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Software at the central key 
        management site should be electronically signed and periodically verified 
        to check the integrity of the code. This provides a means of detecting 
        the unauthorized modification of system software. Within a cryptomodule, 
        this feature of generating and verifying a cryptographic checksum is required 
        by FIPS 140-1.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>- Ensure that a system implemented 
        for a federal government agency has its centrally stored keys and system 
        software controlled by federal employees.</I></font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Proper control of central/root 
        keys and key management software and hardware is critical to the security 
        of the system. In the situation where a federal agency operates a system 
        that was developed by a contractor, federal employees should be in control 
        of this material. This also applies to configuring the key management 
        hardware and software. Once the system goes live, unlimited access to 
        central data, code, and cryptomodules should not be given to nonfederal 
        employees, including those who were contracted to develop and/or maintain 
        the system. </font></P>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Key management provides the 
        foundation for the secure generation, storage, distribution, and translation 
        of keys. Another role of key management is key maintenance, specifically 
        the update/replacement of keys at the completion of a cryptoperiod. The 
        cryptoperiod is determined based on the sensitivity of the information 
        and the risk of key compromise.</font></P>

      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The generation of keys is the 
        most sensitive of all cryptographic functions. Any inadequacies in the 
        implementation of the key-generation function or in the physical security 
        safeguards of that function will seriously undermine the integrity of 
        other cryptographic mechanisms. The physical security measures are necessary 
        to prevent unauthorized disclosure, insertion, and deletion of the system 
        or keys produced by the system. Specifically, all automated resources 
        which generate keys and initialization vectors (IVs) should be physically 
        protected to prevent:</font></P>
    <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">disclosure, modification, 
          and replacement of the keys,<br>

          of the generation algorithm or device.</font></li> 
    </ul>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Depending on the desired management 
        structure, there are some applications where the generation of keys is 
        desirable and other applications where the distribution of keys from another 
        source, such as a central authority, may be more desirable.</font></P>
      <H3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Key Use</font></H3>
      <P><I><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Cryptographic keys may need 
        special physical protection.</font></I></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If keys or key components are 
        stored on a token (e.g., floppy disk, personal computer (PC) card, smartcard, 
        etc.), this token may have to be stored in a special manner to prevent 
        unauthorized individuals from accessing the key or key component. For 
        example, if key components for starting a Certification Authority (CA) 
        or Key Management Facility are stored on tokens which are secured in a 
        safe, multiple people might have access to this token. Therefore, additional 
        protection is needed for each token, possibly by using a tamper-evident 
        envelope, to enable the token's owner to determine if another person used 
        a token.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>- Authentication timeout 
        features are important for protecting keys from compromise or misuse.</I></font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An authentication timeout feature 
        for a cryptographic module or token is important to minimize the possibility 
        of an unauthorized individual accessing an &quot;active&quot; cryptomodule 
        and using its cryptographic keys. This could happen if a cryptomodule 
        is left unattended by a user who has authenticated to it and loaded their 
        cryptographic keys. One alternative is to force a user to periodically 
        reauthenticate oneself to a cryptomodule, rather than allow them to stay 
        logged in for an indefinite amount of time. For sensitive applications, 
        it may be necessary to restrict the hours during which this can take place. 
        </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I>- Key recovery capabilities 
        are important.</I></font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IT systems must protect the 
        confidentiality of information. There must be safeguards to ensure that 
        sensitive records are neither irretrievably lost by the rightful owners 
        nor accessed by unauthorized individuals. Key recovery capabilities provide 
        these controls. All key components should be available to an organization 
        regardless of whether the associated user is currently working in the 
        organization. Employees leave organizations voluntarily and some are removed; 
        in either situation, the organization may need to access the key components 
        to recover encrypted data. Key recovery capabilities allow organizations 
        to restore key components.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is very important to have 
        backup copies of central/root keys, since the compromise or loss of those 
        components could prevent access to keys in the central database, and possibly

        it should extend well beyond the lifetime of a key (where the lifetime 
        is the time during which a key can be used to generate a signature and/or 
        perform encryption). Keys should be archived for a lengthy cryptoperiod 
        (on the order of decades), so that they can be used to verify signatures

        are used, and the security services which are provided by the keys (user/data 
        authentication, confidentiality, data integrity, etc.). Reissuing keys 
        should not be done so often that it becomes burdensome; however, it should 
        be performed often enough to minimize the loss caused by a possible key
