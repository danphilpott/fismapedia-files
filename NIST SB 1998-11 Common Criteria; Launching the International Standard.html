      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Common Criteria (CC) for 
        Information Technology (IT) Security Evaluation is the new standard for 
        specifying and evaluating the security features of computer products and 
        systems. The CC is intended to replace previous security criteria used 
        in North America and Europe with a standard that can be used everywhere 
        in the world. The CC will become International Standard (IS) 15408 in 
        early 1999.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Developing the CC has been 
        a five-year international project involving NIST and the National Security 
        Agency (NSA), on behalf of the United States, and security organizations 
        in Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. They 
        have worked in close cooperation with the International Organization for 
        Standardization (ISO).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the United States, the 
        new international standard CC has formed the basis for the National Information 
        Assurance Partnership (NIAP), a joint activity of NIST and NSA to establish 
        an IT product security evaluation program supported by a number of accredited, 
        independent testing laboratories. The main goals of NIAP are to establish 
        cost-effective evaluation of security-capable IT products and to promote 
        the wide availability of tested products to federal agencies and others, 
        thus playing a crucial role in helping to protect the U.S. information 
        infrastructure. (Note: A glossary at the end of the bulletin defines key 
        terms used throughout the document.)</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Purpose of CC</B><BR>
        The CC will be used as the basis for evaluation of the security properties 
        of IT products and systems. By using such a common criteria base, a wider 
        audience may find the results of an IT security evaluation meaningful. 
        The CC permits comparability among the results of independent security 
        evaluations. It does so by providing a common set of requirements for 
        the security functions of IT products and systems and the assurance measures 
        applied to them during a security evaluation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The evaluation process establishes 
        a level of confidence that the security functions of such products and 
        systems and the assurance measures applied to them must meet. The evaluation 
        results may help consumers to determine whether the IT product or system 
        is secure enough for their intended application and whether the security 
        risks implicit in its use are tolerable.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The CC supports the development 
        of standardized sets of well understood IT product security requirements 
        by user communities in the form of Protection Profiles (PPs) for use in 
        procurements and advice to manufacturers. Manufacturers can use similar 
        sets of CC-based requirements to describe the security capabilities of 
        their products. These are called Security Targets (STs), which can then 
        be used as the basis for security evaluations of those products. Security 
        evaluations are formalized testing and analytic processes that use the 
        CC to determine whether IT products have been correctly developed to specification 
        and whether they are effective in countering the security problems as 
        claimed. Users can integrate evaluated IT products into their systems 
        with increased confidence that their claimed security features will operate 
        as intended.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Earlier Security Criteria 
        Work</B><BR>
        The CC represents the outcome of a long series of efforts to develop criteria 
        for the security evaluation of IT products and systems that can be broadly 
        useful within the international community. In the early 1980s, NSA developed 
        the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC or "Orange Book"). 
        NSA has used the TCSEC extensively since then in its IT security product 
        evaluation program.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the succeeding decade, 
        various countries initiated the development of evaluation criteria that 
        built upon the concepts of the TCSEC but were more flexible and adaptable 
        to the evolving nature of IT.</font></p>
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In Europe, the European 
          Commission published the Information Technology Security Evaluation 
          Criteria (ITSEC) in 1991 after joint development by France, Germany, 
          the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In Canada, the Canadian 
          Trusted Computer Product Evaluation Criteria (CTCPEC) were published 
          in early 1993 as a combination of the ITSEC and TCSEC approaches. </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the United States, NIST 
          and NSA jointly developed the draft Federal Criteria for Information 
          Technology Security (FC) version 1.0, which was also published in early 
          1993 as a second approach to combining North American and European concepts 
          for evaluation criteria. </font>
      </UL>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Work began in 1990 in ISO 
        to develop an international standard evaluation criteria for general use. 
        The new criteria were to be responsive to the need for mutual recognition 
        of standardized security evaluation results in a global IT market. This 
        task was assigned to the Joint Technical Committee 1 - Information Technology 
        (JTC1), subcommittee 27 - Security Techniques (SC27), Working Group 3 
        - Security Criteria (WG3).</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Development of the Common 
        Criteria</B><BR>
        In June 1993, the seven organizations responsible for all the North American 
        and European security criteria (listed at end of bulletin) pooled their 
        efforts to align their separate criteria into a single set of widely useful 
        international IT security criteria. This joint multi-national activity, 
        named the CC Project, sought to resolve the conceptual and technical differences 
        among the source criteria.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The results were to be delivered 
        to WG3 as a contribution to the international standard criteria under 
        development.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The CC Project sponsoring 
        organizations formed the CC Editorial Board (CCEB) to develop the CC. 
        They established a formal cooperative liaison with WG3 and contributed 
        several early versions of the CC to WG3's work, which were in turn influenced 
        by WG3 experts' interaction. Beginning in 1994, WG3 adopted these versions 
        as successive working drafts of the ISO criteria.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Version 1.0 of the CC was 
        completed in January 1996 and distributed by ISO in April 1996 as a Committee 
        Draft (CD). The CC Project used this version to perform a number of trial 
        evaluations. A widespread public review of the document was also conducted.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The CC Implementation Board 
        (CCIB) extensively revised the CC based on the results of trial use, public 
        review, and interaction with ISO. Working closely with WG3, the CCIB completed 
        CC version 2.0 in April 1998 and it was sent out by ISO for balloting 
        as a Final Committee Draft. In October 1998, WG3 slightly revised the 
        document and approved it as Final Draft International Standard 15408, 
        for final balloting in the winter of 1998. The document is expected to 
        become IS 15408 in early 1999 without further change.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> For historical and continuity 
        purposes, ISO has accepted the continued use of the term "Common Criteria" 
        (CC) within the document, while recognizing that the official ISO name 
        for the new IS 15408 is "Evaluation Criteria for Information Technology 
        Security."</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>CC Project Sponsoring Organizations</B><BR>
        The seven European and North American governmental organizations provided 
        nearly all of the effort that went into developing the CC from its inception 
        to its completion. These organizations are also "evaluation authorities," 
        managing product security evaluation programs for their respective national 
        governments. They have committed themselves to replacing their respective 
        evaluation criteria with the new IS 15408. Their goal is mutual recognition 
        of each other's security product evaluation results, permitting a wider 
        global market for good IT security products.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Interim Mutual Recognition</B><BR>
        In April 1996, NIST in cooperation with NSA published a bulletin called 
        "Guidance on the Selection of Low Level Assurance Evaluated Products." 
        The bulletin recommended TCSEC Class C2 - "Controlled Access Protection" 
        as an acceptable minimum set of security criteria for general use in low-threat 
        environments. The bulletin also publicly acknowledged that the Canadian 
        CTCPEC and the European ITSEC contained similar requirements.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The NIST bulletin recognized 
        that, while full equivalency among these three criteria was not easy to 
        establish, enough similarities existed to recommend the use of low-level 
        assurance products evaluated under any of them. The bulletin also noted 
        that equivalency should cease to be an issue once the CC is adopted and 
        implemented by the participating countries.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> With the advent of CC version 
        2.0 and its ISO counterpart, IS 15408, supported by the CC-based Mutual 
        Recognition Arrangement signed by these countries in October 1998 (see 
        end of bulletin), equivalency is no longer an issue.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Three Parts of the CC</B><BR>
        Part 1 - Introduction and General Model Part 1 introduces the CC. It defines 
        general concepts and principles of IT security evaluation and presents 
        a general model of evaluation. Part 1 also defines constructs for expressing 
        IT security objectives, for selecting and defining IT security requirements, 
        and for writing high-level specifications for products and systems. These 
        constructs are called Protection Profiles (PPs), Security Targets (STs) 
        and packages, and are described in a later section. In addition, Part 
        1 describes the usefulness of each part of the CC in terms of each of 
        the target audiences.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Part 2 - Security Functional 
        Requirements Part 2 contains a catalog of well-defined and understood 
        security functional requirements that are intended to be used as a standard 
        way of expressing the security requirements for IT products and systems. 
        The catalog is organized into classes, families, and components.</font></p>
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Classes are high-level 
          groupings of families of requirements, all sharing a common security 
          focus (e.g., identification and authentication). </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Families are lower-level 
          groupings of requirement components, all sharing specific security objectives 
          but differing in rigor or emphasis (e.g., user authentication). </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Components are the lowest 
          selectable requirements that may be included in PPs, STs, or packages 
          (e.g., unforgeable user authentication). </font>
      </UL>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Part 2 also includes an extensive 
        annex of application notes for applying the material that it contains. 
        While it is possible to explicitly state functional requirements not included 
        in the Part 2 catalog in building CC-based constructs (PPs, STs, and packages), 
        that course is not advised unless it is clearly not practical to use Part 
        2 components. Using functional requirements not part of the catalog could 
        jeopardize widespread acceptance of the result.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Part 3 - Security Assurance 
        Requirements Part 3 contains a catalog that establishes a set of assurance 
        components that can be used as a standard way of expressing the assurance 
        requirements for IT products and systems. The Part 3 catalog is organized 
        into the same class - family - component structure as Part 2. Part 3 also 
        defines evaluation criteria for PPs and STs. Part 3 presents the seven 
        Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs), which are predefined packages of assurance 
        components that make up the CC scale for rating confidence in the security 
        of IT products and systems.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The EALs have been developed 
        with the goal of preserving the concepts of assurance drawn from the source 
        criteria (TCSEC, ITSEC, and CTCPEC) so that results of previous evaluations 
        remain relevant. For example, EALs levels 2-7 are generally equivalent 
        to the assurance portions of the TCSEC C2-A1 scale. Note, however, that 
        this equivalency should be used with caution as the levels do not derive 
        assurance in the same manner, and exact mappings do not exist.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As with Part 2, it is possible 
        but not necessarily advisable to explicitly state assurance requirements 
        not from Part 3 or to augment EAL packages with additional Part 3 components. 
        Mutual recognition of product evaluation results is based largely on the 
        EAL, so use of unique combinations of assurance requirements could jeopardize 
        international acceptance of products evaluated against them.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Key Concepts</B><BR>
        The CC defines three useful constructs for putting IT security requirements 
        from Parts 2 and 3 together: the PP, the ST, and the package. The CC has 
        been developed around the central notion of using in these constructs, 
        wherever possible, the security requirements in Parts 2 and 3 of the CC, 
        which represent a well-known and understood domain.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Protection Profile</B><BR>
        The PP is an implementation-independent statement of security needs for 
        a set of IT security products that could be built. The PP contains a set 
        of security requirements, preferably taken from the catalogs in Parts 
        2 and 3, which should include an EAL. A PP is intended to be a reusable 
        definition of product security requirements that are known to be useful 
        and effective.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> A PP could be developed by 
        user communities, IT product developers, or other parties interested in 
        defining such a common set of requirements. A PP gives consumers a means 
        of referring to a specific set of security needs and communicating them 
        to manufacturers. The PP also helps future product evaluation against 
        those needs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The PP contains the following

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Security Target</B><BR>
        An ST is a statement of security claims for a particular IT security product 
        or system. The ST parallels the structure of the PP, though it has additional 
        elements that include product-specific detailed information. The ST contains 
        a set of security requirements for the product or system, which may be 
        made by reference to a PP, directly by reference to CC functional or assurance 
        components, or stated explicitly. An ST is the basis for agreement among 
        all parties as to what security the product or system offers, and therefore 
        the basis for its security evaluation. The ST contains a summary specification, 
        which defines the specific measures taken in the product or system to 
        meet the security requirements.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Package</B><BR>
        An intermediate combination of security requirement components is termed 
        a package. The package permits the expression of a set of either functional 
        or assurance requirements that meet some particular need, expressed as 
        a set of security objectives. A package is intended to be reusable and 
        to define requirements that are known to be useful and effective in meeting 
        the identified objectives. A package may be used in the construction of 
        more complex packages or PPs and STs. The seven evaluation assurance levels 
        (EALs) contained in Part 3 are predefined assurance packages.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Target of Evaluation</B><BR>
        The TOE is an IT product or system to be evaluated, the security characteristics 
        of which are described in specific terms by a corresponding ST, or in 
        more general terms by a PP. In CC philosophy, it is important that a product 
        or system be evaluated against the specific set of criteria expressed 
        in the ST. This evaluation consists of rigorous analysis and testing performed 
        by an accredited, independent laboratory. The scope of a TOE evaluation 
        is set by the EAL and other requirements specified in the ST. Part of 
        this process is an evaluation of the ST itself, to ensure that it is correct, 
        complete, and internally consistent and can be used as the baseline for 
        the TOE evaluation.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Uses of the CC</B><BR>
        The CC is used in two general ways:</font></p>
      <UL TYPE="DISC">
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As a standardized way to 
          describe security requirements, e.g., PPs and STs for IT products and 
          systems; and </font>
        <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As a sound technical basis 
          for evaluating the security features of these products and systems. 
          </font>
      </UL>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The following hypothetical 
        scenarios describe these two uses.</font></p>
      <BLOCKQUOTE> 
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Describing security requirements</B><BR>
          In a typical PP development scenario, a community of users (e.g., a 
          banking consortium) will determine that a standardized set of security 
          capabilities should be used in software or hardware on their systems. 
          They will begin to construct a PP to express those common requirements. 
          They will first identify the type of product or products envisioned 
          and the general IT features needed. They will then consider the environment 
          in which it will operate, in particular identifying the security problems 
          and challenges that must be addressed. That activity is, in essence, 
          a risk analysis and leads to a statement of general needs or security 
          objectives to be met both by the product and by its environment. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Security objectives are 
          transformed by use of the CC Part 2 catalog into a set of coherent and 
          mutually supportive IT security functional requirements statements. 
          Based on the desired level of confidence in the security of products 
          to be built, an EAL from Part 3 is assigned. (Note that the higher the 
          EAL, the greater the burden on the product developer, and consequently 
          the more time and money needed to bring the product to complete availability.)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The outcome of the process 
          just described is a PP. It is desirable that the PP be submitted to 
          an independent testing laboratory for evaluation, to ensure that it 
          is correct, complete, and internally consistent. The PP may then be 
          entered into a central registry for use by the community to communicate 
          the product security needs to manufacturers, either informally or by 
          incorporation into procurement documents.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The preceding scenario involving 
          a user community is only one possible approach to developing a PP, although 
          it is the most commonly expected approach. It is also possible for one 
          or several manufacturers to develop a PP that incorporates the features 
          of their products, as a means of communication with potential users, 
          ensuring interoperability via standardization or for other purposes.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Evaluating product security</B><BR>
          In a typical product evaluation scenario, a manufacturer identifies 
          a market niche for an IT product with security capability. This niche 
          may be represented by a PP incorporating the product desires of a group 
          of users and potential customers. The manufacturer builds the product, 
          following the PP-specified functional requirements from CC Part 2 and 
          the developer assurance requirements in the EAL from Part 3. Once the 
          product is built, the manufacturer prepares an ST, which in the simplest 
          case makes a claim of compliance with a particular PP, thereby covering 
          the functional and assurance requirements for the product. The manufacturer 
          also develops as part of the ST a summary specification of the ways 
          that the product's features meet these requirements. The manufacturer 
          then submits the ST, the product, and accompanying documentation to 
          an accredited, independent testing laboratory for evaluation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The laboratory evaluates 
          the ST, to determine that it is a sound baseline for evaluation of the 
          product and that any claims of PP compliance are supportable. The laboratory 
          then proceeds to evaluate the product and its documentation against 
          the ST. If the product passes evaluation, it can be submitted to an 
          evaluation authority for validation of the evaluation results.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While definitely preferable, 
          it is not necessary for a product to claim compliance with a PP. In 
          the absence of PP claims, the ST is prepared in a process similar to 
          that described for the PP. The evaluation of the ST and then the corresponding 
          product can proceed as before, but no PP compliance claims will be examined.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Validating the results</B><BR>
          An integral part of the CC-based process, as described in its Part 1, 
          is the independent validation of evaluation results in order to ensure 
          that a product's evaluation was conducted properly. An evaluation authority 
          is a body that implements the CC for a specific community, responsible 
          for setting the standards and monitoring the quality of evaluations 
          conducted by testing laboratories within that community. Each of the 
          CC partners is an evaluation authority for the government of its respective 
          country.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> NIST and NSA work together 
          as a single U.S. authority, as described below. The evaluation authority 
          is responsible for overseeing all evaluations in its jurisdiction, qualitatively 
          reviewing the results, and certifying or validating the findings. The 
          term "validation" is used in the U.S. for this process, while the other 
          CC partners use "certification," but the process is the same. Upon validation 
          of a successful product evaluation, the product is awarded a CC certificate 
          and is added to an official validated products list available to the 
          public.</font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Evaluating installed 
          systems</B><BR>
          Another way that the CC process can be used is to evaluate installed 
          systems for such purposes as system certification and accreditation 
          programs used in several federal agencies. The organization responsible 
          for certifying a system's secure operation could develop an ST describing 
          the system architecture, its functions and operational environment, 
          and the security features it embodies. An independent entity, such as 
          an accredited testing laboratory, could then perform an on-site evaluation 
          of the system against the ST, providing a report to support a request 
          for accreditation.</font></p>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>CC Evaluation Programs</B> 
        <BR>
        Numerous organizations throughout the world are now implementing the CC, 
        including all of the CC project partners (listed below), as well as other 
        European Union nations, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, and parts 
        of the former Soviet Union. It is expected that this number will grow 
        significantly as soon as the CC is formally published as International 
        Standard 15408 in early 1999.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the U.S., NIST and NSA 
        jointly operate the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP). 
        NIAP is a broadly based program that operates principally as the CC-based 
        evaluation authority for the federal government. NIAP is dedicated to 
        demonstrating the value of independent testing and validation as a measure 
        of security and trust in IT products. Through its efforts, NIAP fosters 
        the establishment and accreditation of commercial IT product security 
        testing laboratories in the U.S.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>The Goal of Mutual Recognition</B> 
        <BR>
        On October 5, 1998, six of the seven CC project partners officially signed 
        a Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA). The purpose of the MRA is to bring 
        about an international situation in which IT products and PPs that earn 
        a CC certificate can be procured and used in different jurisdictions without 
        the need for them to be evaluated and certified/validated more than once. 
        By recognizing the results of each other's evaluations, products evaluated 
        in one MRA member nation can be accepted in the other member nations. 
        It is anticipated that, as other nations develop high quality IT product 
        security evaluation programs, they too may seek to join the MRA. This 
        path is open to other evaluation authorities upon demonstration that they 
        can fulfill the stringent technical and procedural conditions for mutual 
        recognition laid down in the MRA.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As product evaluations can 
        be costly and time-consuming, both manufacturers and users have welcomed 
        the MRA breakthrough. The anticipated outcome is a "level playing field" 
        for multi-national IT product manufacturers, leading to a much wider availability 
        of useful IT security products to secure the global information infrastructure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> These two factors have been 
        the major goal of the CC project from its inception and have been the 
        driving force and vision that empowered the ISO criteria activity as well. 
        The joint development of the CC has created an environment of mutual respect 
        among the partners, and the CC itself has formed the technical basis for 
        mutual recognition, both of which were necessary for the inception of 
        the MRA.</font></p>
