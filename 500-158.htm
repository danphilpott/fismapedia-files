<p>Recommendations are provided to promote accuracy, integrity, and security in
computerized vote-tallying, and to improve confidence in the results produced.
The recommendations respond to identified problems, and concern software,
hardware, operational procedures, and institutional changes.</p>

<p>It is proposed that the concept of internal control, almost universally used
to protect operations that produce priced goods or services, be adapted to
vote-tallying, a non-priced service. For software, recommendations concern
certification, assurance of logical correctness, and protection against
contamination by hidden code. For hardware, recommendations concern accuracy of
ballot reading, and design and certification of vote-tallying systems that do
not use ballots. Improved pre-election testing and partial manual recounting of
ballots are recommended operational procedures.</p>

<p>Some recent significant events concerning computerized vote-tallying are
reported. These events include development of performance specifications,
publication of a series of <u>New York Times</u> articles, and activities in
Texas leading to passage of a revised statute on electronic voting systems.
Relative vulnerabilities of different types of vote-tallying systems, i.e.,
punch card, mark-sense, and direct recording electronic, are discussed. Certain
recent elections in which difficulties occurred are reviewed, and categories of
failures are highlighted.</p>

<p><b>1. <u>SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p>This report has been prepared with funding provided by the John and Mary R.
Markle Foundation of New York City. The Markle Foundation requested that the
National Bureau of Standards (NBS) undertake this study because of concern
about the potential for inaccuracy or fraud in computerized vote-tallying. NBS
was approached because of its experience with the subject matter as a result of
a previous project undertaken by the author for the U.S. General Accounting
Office.</p>

<p>Concern had been heightened by a series of articles published in the summer
of 1985 in the <u>New York Times</u>. The articles cited statements by two
computer experts reporting that a computer program widely used for
vote-tallying was vulnerable to tampering. Several elections were identified in
which losing candidates claimed that it would be possible to fraudulently alter
the computer programs that were used in their contests.</p>

<p>1.1 <u>Problems Of Computerized Vote-Tallying<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>In preparation for this report, a review of recent public statements and
documents was undertaken that indicated concern about computerized
vote-tallying. The review showed that the problems could be categorized as
follows: there is difficulty in verifying results; there is the possibility of
undiscoverable frauds; and election administrators lack some necessary
knowledge and resources.</p>

<p>While proof of actual computer program manipulation appears to be lacking,
documentation conclusively demonstrating otherwise is generally insufficient,
due to the manner in which many computerized elections are conducted. It has
been clearly shown that audit trails that document election results, as well as
general practices to assure accuracy, integrity, and security, can be
considerably improved.</p>

<p>1.2 <u>Government Responsibilities<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The recommendations that respond to these problems are directed to State and
local government election officials. Elections for State and Federal offices
are conducted by local government (generally county, township, and city)
administrators. In about one-third of all counties, voting is carried out using
computerized equipment. Jurisdictions using computerized equipment include over
one-half of all registered voters.</p>

<p>Local administrators require the necessary resources and expertise to
efficiently and effectively carry out their responsibilities. These
responsibilities generally include procurement of vote-tallying systems and
supporting services. An effective procurement must include specifications that
assure accuracy, integrity, and security. The local administrators also have
the responsibility for implementing the necessary management control systems to
enable the public to have confidence in the results produced.</p>

<p>Election officials require a source of neutral expertise for the receipt of
new technical and administrative information. The establishment of the Election
Center in the Academy for State and Local Government clearly fulfills a need.
Its efforts should be expanded.</p>

<p>1.3 <u>Implementation Of An Internal Control Function<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Internal control is a set of systematic procedures used to guard against
errors, waste, and fraud. It is nearly universally used as a management
technique to safeguard assets, and to protect operations that result in goods
or services priced for sale. Voting services are not priced, and the discipline
of internal control has not been systematically applied. Applicability of the
discipline to vote-tallying requires only the re-definition of the concept of a
transaction. A transaction is now defined as a business event that is measured
in money and that is entered into accounting records; a re-definition would
allow a transaction to include a step in the implementation of an entitlement
that is not measured in money.</p>

<p>Essential recommendations are that the concept of internal control should be
re-defined as indicated, and that persons knowledgeable in that professional
field should be utilized to assist in the establishment and implementation of
sound operational procedures. To the extent that procured computerized voting
equipment and software must have capabilities that support internal control,
applicable requirements should be included in procurement specifications.</p>

<p>Expertise in internal control (which includes computer security) should be
added to the personnel complement in election administration in order to assure
implementation of applicable concepts. In addition, an internal auditor should
be available to independently review the implementation of internal controls
and report on their effectiveness. Internal control is a professional activity;
trained persons, texts, and a community of practitioners are available.
Internal control expertise may be shared among government agencies or provided
at the State level if individual agency resources are insufficient.</p>

<p>An important function of internal control is to identify system
vulnerabilities and convert them into a set of realistic threats. Responses
must be devised that are consistent with available or obtainable resources,
based on a risk analysis determining the likelihood and cost of actual
exploitation of a particular vulnerability. As a result, internal controls
personnel should be able to provide assurances to the public that the potential
threats are understood, have been prioritized for significance, and are being
countered.</p>

<p>The availability of internal control specialists should relieve election
administrators from having to be personally knowledgeable about specific
technical matters best left to individuals who are professionally qualified in
that field. With the addition of needed technical resources to the staff,
election administrators would be able to retain management control.
Administrators would not have to abdicate control to others, such as vendors or
data processing center directors. Thus, election administrators would be able
to retain the capability of managing the process of assuring accuracy,
integrity, and security in vote-tallying.</p>

<p>1.4 <u>FEC Clearinghouse Specifications<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The performance specifications being developed by the National Clearinghouse
on Election Administration of the Federal Election Commission (FEC
Clearinghouse) are approaching completion. They are intended for Statewide
adoption. Each State should consider the adoption of these specifications when
they are issued.</p>

<p>Acceptance procedures for hardware and software should be consistent with
the FEC Clearinghouse implementation plan for adoption of these specifications.
That plan calls for qualification and certification prior to final acceptance.
Qualification implies conformance with standards and functional requirements,
and may be done once to satisfy many States. Certification ensures that the
product meets State requirements. Acceptance testing evaluates the degree to
which the specific units delivered to the local government conform to approved
characteristics.</p>

<p>1.5 <u>Revised Texas Statute On Electronic Voting Systems<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The requirements of the revised Texas statute on electronic voting systems
should be considered for adoption in those States that have not already adopted
equivalent or more stringent provisions. Requirements of the Texas statute
include audit trails, deposit of computer programs with the secretary of state,
assurance that programs used in vote-tallying are identical to those deposited,
mandatory one percent manual recount of all contests, testing of equipment
using all applicable ballot formats, disconnect of remote terminals during vote
tabulations, and specific scrutiny of ballot count discrepancies. </p>

<p>1.6 <u>Recommendations On Software<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>1.6.1 Certification</p>

<p>Products to be certified should include all vote-tallying software and all
software to be mounted together with vote-tallying software. Certification
implies State approval. Only certified software should be permitted to be used
within the State. After software has been certified, no design changes should
be permitted without a re-certification. All software that has been certified
should be deposited with the chief election official of the State. Consistent
with the revised Texas statute, the materials on file should not be public
information, but should be available to law enforcement authorities, on proper
application, for investigation of election irregularities.</p>

<p>Specialization of vote-tallying software for a particular election should
occur only with a &quot;fill-in-the-blanks&quot; procedure, not with logic
design changes. Header cards used in vote-tallying operations should not change
the logic of a program.</p>

<p>1.6.2 Integrity and Logical Correctness</p>

<p>As a requirement for certification, all vote-tallying software, and all
software used with it, should be reviewed for integrity, that is, for the
ability to carry out its asserted function and to contain no hidden code.
Vote-tallying software should be tested, in addition, for logical correctness.
Vote-tallying software includes software for election specialization and ballot
generation, as well as vote-summarizing software. Satisfaction of the
requirements may be done as part of qualification.</p>

<p>As part of the effort to maintain integrity of software, accountability of
the source is essential. Copying of software from unaccountable sources must be
forbidden. To minimize requirements for testing, all software should be
obtained from a stock of products offered publicly by reputable vendors.
Software that cannot be obtained in this manner must be thoroughly checked.</p>

<p>1.6.3 Dedicated Software Use and Dedicated Operation</p>

<p>An important procedure to assure system integrity is to isolate
vote-tallying and support software from influences over which the election
administration has no control.</p>

<p>After all software to be used together has been certified, it should be
maintained separately under the control of the election administration and not
used together with uncertified software. It is strongly recommended that
certified vote-tallying software not be allowed to run on a multiprogrammed
general-purpose computer on which uncertified support software or applications
also are being run.</p>

<p>1.7 <u>Recommendations On Hardware<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>1.7.1 Accuracy Of Ballot Reading</p>

<p>The value of a ballot-tallying system is that it should be possible, with a
recount, to duplicate the result of an election. The problems found in ballot-reader
inaccuracy, both in the count of ballots, and in the count of votes on ballots,
are a significant source of lack of confidence in vote-tallying.</p>

<p>A recommended goal is that a computerized vote count should be able to be
reproduced on a recount with no more than a change in one vote for each ballot
position in ballot quantities of up to 100,000 when machine-generated (ideal)
ballots are used. A ballot reader should be able to tolerate a wide range of
punching or marking behavior by a voter without a significant increase in
error.</p>

<p>1.7.2 Elimination of Pre-Scored Punch Card Ballots </p>

<p>The use of pre-scored punch cards contributes to the inaccuracy and to the
lack of confidence. It is generally not possible to exactly duplicate a count
obtained on pre-scored punch cards, given the inherent physical characteristics
of these ballots and the variability in the ballot-punching performance of real
voters. </p>

<p>It is recommended that the use of pre-scored punch card ballots be ended.
One method now available to eliminate pre-scored cards, while retaining the
&quot;votomatic&quot; concept, is with a new type of hole-punching stylus that
uses spring-loading. A hole of consistent and acceptable dimensions can be
created by a voter using the new stylus without the need for pre-scoring. The
internal construction of the &quot;votomatic&quot; ballot holder must be
altered with the use of the new stylus. Other devices and methods for
elimination of pre-scored punch card ballots also may be effective.</p>

<p>1.7.3 Counting of Rejected Ballots</p>

<p>If a ballot cannot be read by machine, administrative controls should be in
place to permit such ballots to be counted manually. A voter's choices should
not be lost because of machine failure.</p>

<p>1.7.4 Required Research</p>

<p>Testing to determine the accuracy of current ballot reading systems (such as
that now being carried out by ECRI of Plymouth Meeting, PA), and research to
improve ballot tallying systems in accuracy and ease of voter use, are
important to pursue.</p>

<p>1.7.5 Design of Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Machines</p>

<p>With DRE machines, no ballot is used. The voter enters choices directly into
a storage unit of the machine with the use of pushbuttons, a touch-screen, or
similar devices. As no voter-generated records of choices exist, and no recount
independent of the machine is possible, steps should be taken in the design of
these machines to assure complete confidence in the reported results.</p>

<p>A problem with most DRE machines as currently designed (as with lever
machines, their predecessors), is that there is no difference in the results
seen between a voter's failure to cast a vote and the machine's failure to
record a vote.</p>

<p><u>Recording of Undervotes</u>: It is recommended that each DRE machine be
designed so as to take a positive action indicating a &quot;no vote&quot; for
every choice that the voter fails to take. When voting is complete, the voter's
choices, and any &quot;no votes&quot; for votes not taken, would be transferred
to a more permanent storage for summation with other voters' choices. The
required transfer and summation of the &quot;no votes&quot; would serve as
positive indications of the voter's failure to make certain specific choices.
Thus, there would be no ambiguity about whether the voter failed to vote or the
machine failed to record selections.</p>

<p><u>Retention of Voter-Choice Sets for Summation Verification</u>: Each
voter-choice set (i.e., the machine's record of all choices of a voter) should
be retained in the machine on a removable non-volatile medium (e.g., magnetic
disk). Storage locations of the voter-choice sets would have to be randomized
to prevent association of a particular set with a particular voter. The
retention of the voter-choice sets makes possible a verification (on an
independent machine) of the DRE machine's summation of the voters' choices that
it recorded. The correctness of the machine's data entry process cannot be
checked in this manner.</p>

<p>1.7.6 Certification of DRE Data Entry Logic</p>

<p>DRE data entry hardware should be certified for logical correctness, by
examination of the logic design and by testing under a large variety of
different conditions. The DRE data entry function must be correct, as there are
no ballots to provide an independent check. The data entry logic and its
documentation should be deposited with the State, as described above in 1.6.1.</p>

<p>1.8 <u>Recommendations On Operational Procedures<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>1.8.1 Pre-Election Checkout</p>

<p>Lack of sufficient pre-election testing appears to be a major source of
operational difficulty. Sufficient pre-election testing should be done so that
errors in software specialization or in implementation of logical rules, if
any, will become obvious. It is recommended that to the greatest extent
possible, all hardware and software to be utilized should be given a dry run
simulating specific conditions to be faced on election day and election night.</p>

<p>1.8.2 Audit Trails</p>

<p>Audit trails provide the supporting documentation through which the
correctness of the reported results may be verified. Two types of audit trails
are necessary to document operations and provide confidence in the results
reported. One type records steps in the operation of the equipment, while the
other records steps in the voting and vote-tallying processes.</p>

<p>1.8.3 Complete Data From Split Precincts</p>

<p>Each split of a split precinct should be treated like a separate precinct
for the reporting of ballots and votes cast. However, voter privacy must be a
concern for splits containing a very small number of voters.</p>

<p>1.8.4 Access Controls</p>

<p>Access (i.e., security) controls must be in place during preparations for
voting, voting itself, and vote-tallying. These controls concern access to
sites, areas, facilities, equipment, documents, files, and data. The controls
cover transportation of ballots and telecommunication of results.</p>

<p>1.8.5 Application Internal Controls for Ballot-Tallying Systems</p>

<p>These controls should be in place to prevent all types of ballot frauds and
miscounting errors, and to provide the documentation and assurance that the
correct results are reported. Controls on ballots cover printing and
distribution, accounting for use, validity, and prevention of errors due to
mishandling. Controls on data and calculations provide for accurate
telecommunication of data, recording of undervotes and overvotes, vote
reconciliations that demonstrate consistency, and assurance of accurate vote
summarization. A manual recount of at least one percent of the ballots of each
contest is recommended. Responsibility for selection of some of the precincts
to be recounted should be granted to candidates or parties.</p>

<p>1.8.6 Application Internal Controls for DRE Systems</p>

<p>These controls should be in place to provide documentation and assurance
that the correct results are reported when DRE systems are used. The controls
cover matching machine use with voter totals, vote reconciliations on each
machine, recounting of voter-choice sets, and post-election checkout of
machines.</p>

<p>1.9 <u>Relative Vulnerabilities Of Different System Types<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Each type of system has its own particular vulnerabilities. A comparison of
system types shows that each has its advantages and disadvantages. It is possible
to effectively utilize any of the computerized systems discussed (punch card,
mark-sense, or DRE) provided that, among other requirements, procurement
specifications are well-written in accordance with needed performance, and
factors of accuracy, reliability, and recommended design concepts are included
in the specifications.</p>

<p>1.10 <u>Review Of Recent Difficulties In Computerized Vote-Tallying<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Ten computerized voting situations in which difficulties occurred are
reviewed in detail in this report. The four situations identified in the <u>New
York Times</u> article of July 29, 1985 are among those reviewed. Problems in
several other situations are briefly described.</p>

<p>Although none of the situations has provided solid evidence of computer
program manipulation, the reviews have revealed the need for improvements in
hardware and software performance and in operational procedures, and they have
provided support for the need for institutional changes. Thus, the reviews have
influenced the recommendations provided in this report.</p>

<p>Specific recommendations directly resulting from the reviews of difficulties
include the recommendations on improved accuracy in ballot tabulation,
elimination of pre-scored punch card ballots, assurance of the counting of
ballots rejected by readers, provision of complete data from split precincts,
and more thoroughness in pre-election checkout.</p>

<p>1.11 <u>Future Vote-Tallying Systems<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>While vote-tallying using telephones or stations similar to automatic teller
machines is technologically feasible, the decision to implement such a system
must be based on more fundamental factors. Any installed system must meet
political and economic requirements, as well as technical requirements of
accuracy and reliability. Political needs include equal access by individuals,
the ability to verify registration, and the ability of the voters to vote in
secret without intimidation. Internal controls must be implementable to
demonstrate the correctness of the reported results. Benefits, such as
increased voter convenience and possible improved participation rates, must be
compared against the costs of implementation.</p>

<p><b>2. <u>BACKGROUND, AND RECENT SIGNIFICANT EVENTS</u> <o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p>This report has been prepared in partial fulfillment of the conditions of
funding received in November, 1986, by the Institute for Computer Sciences and
Technology (ICST) of NBS from the John and Mary R. Markle Foundation of New
York City. The Markle Foundation is privately endowed, and has a programmatic
interest in the role of computer technology and communications in public
affairs.</p>

<p>As a nonregulatory agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, NBS was
established in 1901 specifically to aid manufacturing, commerce, government,
and academia through application of its expertise in science and technology. In
connection with its consulting role, NBS may accept outside funding that is
consistent with its mission and programs.</p>

<p>ICST carries out the responsibilities mandated to the Department of Commerce
under the Brooks Act (P.L. 89-306). ICST develops techniques and tools to help
organizations make more effective use of computers and information technology.
In addition, ICST serves government and industry by developing Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS), technical reports, and test methods,
and by providing technical assistance to advance new uses of computer
technology. In 1987, additional responsibilities were assigned to ICST due to
the passage of the Computer Security Act (P.L. 100-235). In accordance with
this act, ICST will develop standards and guidelines on computer security to
protect the U.S. Government's sensitive but unclassified information.</p>

<p>2.1 <u>Accuracy, Integrity, And Security<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>This report concerns measures to assure the presence of accuracy, integrity,
and security in computerized vote-tallying. Accuracy is the essential
requirement of a computerized vote-tallying system, but its achievement may not
be possible without the implementation of integrity and security. Even if
accuracy is attained, confidence in the results may not be assured unless the
other two factors can be shown to be present. Thus, for vote-tallying systems,
these factors are not mutually exclusive parameters that can be separately
considered.</p>

<p>Definitions, for the purpose of this report, are as follows:</p>

<p><u>accuracy</u>: conformity of the output data of a vote-tallying system
with logically correct and acceptably precise treatment of all input data
provided to the system;</p>

<p><u>integrity</u>: the state of a vote-tallying system in which it will
correctly perform the functions specified for it, and only those functions;</p>

<p><u>security</u>: the achievement of a desired control of access to
vote-tallying facilities, areas, equipment, supplies, documents, media, files,
and data.</p>

<p>2.2 <u>ICST's 1974/1975 Project On Computerized Voting<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The origins of the current project go back to 1974. In February of that
year, ICST was asked by the General Accounting Office (GAO) to &quot;conduct a
systems analysis and evaluation of the role of automatic digital processing
equipment in the vote-tallying process.&quot; The year-long project, undertaken
also by the author of this latest report, was completed in 1975.</p>

<p>The project had been requested by the GAO through one of its components, the
National Clearinghouse on Election Administration of the Office of Federal
Elections, in recognition of concerns expressed in Congress, and by election
officials and the public, about the use of computing technology in
vote-tallying. These concerns had been aroused by the issue of the potential
for the fraudulent alteration of vote-tallying computer programs, and by actual
difficulties experienced in computer-based elections. The possibility of
fraudulent manipulation of computer programs had been raised by computer
experts in Los Angeles in 1969. Serious problems in computerized vote-tallying
had been experienced in San Francisco in 1968, in Los Angeles and Detroit in
1970, in Los Angeles and Houston in 1972, and in other places in the years
immediately prior to the request for the report.</p>

<p>The product of the 1974/1975 project was a report entitled <u>Effective Use
of Computing Technology in Vote-Tallying</u> [1]. The report identified the
hardware, software, and administrative problems that had been encountered at
that time, and specified operational guidelines that election administrators
could implement to help assure the accuracy and security of the vote-tallying
process. Several thousand copies of the report were distributed to election
administrators throughout the nation by the National Clearinghouse on Election
Administration. That organization, in 1975, had become a part of the newly
established Federal Election Commission; it is identified elsewhere in this
report as the FEC Clearinghouse.</p>

<p>2.3 <u>Some Pertinent Technological Changes Since 1975<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Since the 1975 report, there have been many additional experiences in the application
of computerized vote-tallying, and considerable improvements in computer
technology. In computer hardware, the most important changes have been improved
speeds of operation, smaller physical size, and availability of larger
quantities of random access and disk memory. The improved speeds and memory
quantities are obtainable at considerable reductions in cost. The lower costs
and improvements in technology have made possible the proliferation of smaller
computers with considerable capability. Thus, it is now possible for many
smaller election administrations to consider the acquisition of their own
computing power, in order to achieve efficiencies and provide more direct
management control over their operations.</p>

<p>There has been, also, continued improvements in tools and techniques for the
management of technology. Tools include the availability of new standards in
computer technology such as for media, programming languages, communications
protocols, and data protection. Techniques include the concepts of software
engineering, computer security, internal control, and EDP (electronic data
processing) auditing.</p>

<p>The changes in computer technology, and the availability of new tools and
techniques, have been considered in the development of the recommendations of
this report.</p>

<p>2.4 <u>Development Of Standards For Voting Equipment</u> </p>

<p>In January, 1980, partly as a result of the 1975 ICST report, Congress
adopted P.L. 96-187, Section 302, which stated that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;The Federal Election Commission, with the
cooperation and assistance of the National Bureau of Standards, shall conduct a
preliminary study with respect to the future development of voluntary
engineering and procedural performance standards for voting systems used in the
United States. The Commission shall report to the Congress the results of the
study, and such report shall include recommendations, if any, for the
implementation of a program of such standards (including estimates of the costs
and time requirements of implementing such a program). The cost of the study
shall be paid out of any funds otherwise available to defray the expenses of
the Commission.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1983, the preliminary study was completed with the recommendation that
&quot;performance standards for voting systems are both needed and
feasible.&quot; In 1984, the FEC Clearinghouse began to develop such standards.
As of the summer of 1988, the hardware, software, and test standards for punch
card, mark-sense, and DRE voting systems are approaching completion [2]. An
executive summary of these standards also is being prepared [3]. The FEC
Clearinghouse has also prepared a draft implementation plan for the voting
system standards [4], and a &quot;System Escrow Plan&quot; [5]. The latter
concerns the problem of controlling access to proprietary source code while States
and local governments (or their agents) are provided with the ability to test
the vote-tallying software for integrity.</p>

<p>Implementation of the standards would address some of the identified
problems of computerized vote-tallying summarized below in section 2.9.</p>

<p>2.5 <u>Establishment Of The Election Center<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The Election Center, affiliated with the Academy for State and Local
Government, was established in 1984. The Center is an independent non-profit
resource center serving registration and election officials. National and
regional election conferences sponsored by the Center, as well as reports and
other data distributed to officials, provide training and information in some
thirty-five areas of election administration.</p>

<p>The Center has recently distributed the report of a workshop [107] held on
Captiva Island, Florida, in February, 1987. The workshop concerned computerized
vote-tallying and included, as participants, election officials, vendors,
computer scientists, and others interested in the election process. The workshop
was funded by grants to the George Washington University by the John and Mary
R. Markle Foundation. The Election Center had no part in the workshop but,
because of its clientele, served as a convenient avenue of distribution for the
report.</p>

<p>The Academy for State and Local Government is a non-profit research
organization that fosters understanding of American government at all levels.
The Academy is governed by a board of trustees composed of the executive
directors of seven organizations representing States, counties, cities, and the
chief officials of these jurisdictions.</p>

<p>2.6 <u>New York Times Articles On Computerized Voting<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>A series of articles on computerized voting was published in the <u>New York
Times</u> in 1985, commencing on July 29 of that year. In the first article,
published on page one and entitled &quot;Computerized Systems for Voting Seen
as Vulnerable to Tampering&quot; [6], it was charged that:</p>

<p>&quot;The computer program that was used to count more than one-third of the
votes cast in the Presidential election last year is very vulnerable to
manipulation and fraud, according to expert witnesses in court actions
challenging local and Congressional elections in three states...</p>

<p>&quot;The vote counting program that has been challenged in Indiana, West
Virginia and Maryland was developed by Computer Election Systems of Berkeley,
Calif. In Indiana and West Virginia, the company has been accused of helping to
rig elections. The computer program has also been challenged in Florida, but so
far experts have not been permitted to examine the program in connection with
the challenge.</p>

<p>&quot;John H. Kemp, president of Computer Election Systems, said in a
telephone interview that he absolutely denied that the company was involved in
fraudulent schemes. County officials involved in the cases also have
categorically denied participation in fraud.&quot;</p>

<p>The article went on to state that allegations that the computer program
provided by Computer Election Systems was &quot;open to manipulation and fraud
were supported by two ... experienced computer consultants who independently
examined material obtained in the pending court cases for the New York
Times.&quot; The two experts cited were Howard Jay Strauss, associate director
of the Princeton University Computer Center, and Eric K. Clemons, an associate
professor of decision sciences at the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Mr. Strauss was reported as saying that &quot;the program used to count
Indiana votes was vulnerable to manipulation.&quot; He was additionally quoted
as follows:</p>

<p>&quot; 'Extra votes may be entered in the form of bogus ballots on punch
cards, or vote totals may be altered through the use of control cards,' Mr.
Strauss said. 'Either of these assaults on the system could be performed
successfully by a computer novice.'</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Strauss added that someone with 'a fair amount of computer
knowledge' could turn off the portion of the program designed to document any
changes made in either the program or the votes being counted by the
program.&quot;</p>

<p>However, an examination of the complete text submitted by Mr. Strauss to the
<u>New York Times</u> shows that he also stated that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;If a better audit trail was part of the
program, and if better procedures were followed in running the program, then
all of the assaults on the system described above [for entering extra votes or
altering votes] could easily be detected...</p>

<p>In addition, in response to the question, &quot;Can the program be made
safer?&quot; Mr. Strauss responded:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;...there is no way to design a tamper proof
program. If prudent procedures are not followed in running it, any program can
be compromised. The NBS publication <u>Effective Use of Computing Technology in
Vote-Tallying</u> makes this point very clearly and provides reasonable
guidelines for designing and running vote-tallying programs.&quot; [7]</p>

<p>These qualifying remarks were not reported in the <u>New York Times</u>
article.</p>

<p>Professor Clemons was quoted in the July 29, 1985 article as saying that
because of the excessive complexity of the program,</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot; '...a doctored version of the code could be
used to modify election results, and it would take weeks of study to determine
what had happened.'</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot; 'Code this complex is very difficult to
trust,' Mr. Clemons said. One particular flaw that he cited was that 'the main
program does not log all invalid ballots.' Another was that the printed log of
error messages could easily by edited or altered.&quot;</p>

<p>An examination of the complete text submitted by Professor Clemons to the <u>New
York Times</u> shows that he also stated that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;This does <u>not</u> mean that the code was
constructed this way in deliberate violation of [FEC Clearinghouse]
recommendations or current practice; this was a very common programming style
in the 60s and mid-70s. And it does <u>not</u> mean that anyone is using the
system to influence election results.&quot; [8]</p>

<p>These qualifying remarks, similarly, were not included in the <u>New York
Times</u> article.</p>

<p>The July 29, 1985 article was distributed by the New York Times News
Service, and also appeared, in whole or in part, in other papers, including the
<u>Greensboro (NC) News &amp; Record</u> and the <u>Norfolk (VA) Virginian-Pilot</u>.</p>

<p>Another article in the series, on August 21, 1985, entitled &quot;Vote by
Computer: Some See Problems&quot; [9], reported that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;Many local election officials are baffled by
computers and are unable to understand, question and challenge the computer
systems.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;Election system vendors are often forced by
competitive bidding pressures to offer jurisdictions the cheapest possible
systems, and the products they offer do not maximize fraud protection.&quot;</p>

<p>In explanation, the article continued:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;The industry has been faced with competition
to produce low-cost systems that can produce a quick tally, but it has not
devoted much attention to devising systems that could be understood by local
officials and that would provide features such as audit trails to make fraud
difficult.&quot;</p>

<p>2.7 <u>California Attorney General's Report<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>In December, 1985, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of
California began a study that was &quot;prompted ... by several nationally
published news stories&quot; [10], by which the <u>New York Times</u> series
was meant. The study concentrated on &quot;an analysis of the nature and extent
of reported problems attending the computerization of the vote counting
process&quot; [11]. Almost every county in California uses computerized
vote-tallying systems, and the systems include a significant number provided by
the vendor named by the <u>New York Times</u>.</p>

<p>The report, on April 23, 1986 by Robert R. Granucci, Deputy Attorney
General, might be summarized with the following quote:</p>

<p>&quot;My general conclusions are that while there have been no proven
instances of vote counting fraud, certain concerns that have been expressed
about the security and accuracy of computerized elections appear to have
validity. However, these concerns are receiving serious attention and
improvements are being made. A principal concern is that the most widely used
vote counting software has been criticized for lacking a reliable audit trail
and having a program structure that is very difficult even for computer
professionals to understand.</p>

<p>&quot;It appears that most of the reported problems associated with
computerized vote counting have occurred the first time the system is used by
local election officials, and decrease in later elections. If experience is any
guide, inaccuracies in tallying election results will tend to diminish as local
election officials gain familiarity with electronic systems, but the potential
for fraud may tend to increase.</p>

<p>&quot;The Attorney General should urge the Secretary of State to require
that all electronic vote tallying systems have reliable, tamper-proof audit
trails.&quot; [12]</p>

<p>(Note: compare final sentence above with Strauss quote in section 2.6 that
&quot;...there is no way to design a tamper-proof program. If prudent
procedures are not followed in running it, any program can be compromised&quot;
[7]. It would seem that the essential need is for &quot;prudent
procedures.&quot;) </p>

<p>The Attorney General's report was publicized by the <u>San Francisco
Examiner</u> in an article on October 20, 1986. The article reported that,
according to the Secretary of State's office, which regulates elections,
&quot;in 25 years, no error has affected the outcome of a California
election.&quot; However, there have been &quot;sporadic glitches,&quot; the
article reported. Several examples were given: in San Francisco in 1983,
&quot;an electrical power fluctuation during the vote count&quot; added votes
incorrectly to one candidate's totals; in Orange County in 1980, &quot;a
computer programmer's mistake&quot; gave about 15,000 votes meant for two
candidates to two other candidates; and in San Joaquin County in 1984, &quot;a
misplaced piece of punch card caused the system to indicate that one precinct
had not been counted when it had been.&quot; [13]</p>

<p>The article also reported that:</p>

<p>&quot;'Rigging a computer vote would require a conspiracy of six to eight
people,' said Deborah Seiler, head of the state secretary of state's computer
voting division. 'The greatest possibility of error that I'm aware of is human
error,'&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;San Francisco Registrar [Jay] Patterson said that many election
offices depend on manufacturers and county data processors to operate the
systems. 'That certainly is not the best of situations when the person
responsible for the vote count is not actually involved in it,' said Patterson.</p>

<p>&quot;Some counties with 'sloppy procedures' have failed to test computer
equipment as required by the state, according to Robert Naegele, a technical
consultant to the state and the Federal Election Commission. Each county must
run 'logic and accuracy tests' of its system before and after the vote
count.&quot; [13]</p>

<p>2.8 <u>Texas Controversy, Hearings, and Legislation: 1986/1987<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>2.8.1 Controversy Over 1985 Dallas Mayoralty Contest</p>

<p>Following the April, 1985, Dallas mayoralty contest, Ms. Terry Elkins,
campaign manager for losing candidate Max Goldblatt, approached the office of
the attorney general of Texas with concerns about the manner in which the
election was conducted. The attorney general's office asked a consultant to
carry out an investigation. As a result of the investigation, Assistant
Attorney General Robert L. Lemens wrote a letter to Ms. Karen Gladney, Director
of Elections for Texas. The letter, on July 15, 1986, included the following
statement:</p>

<p>&quot;...although [the consultant] has insufficient evidence to conclude
that fraud has been committed, the electronic voting system in use lacks
adequate security features to provide any assurances of the absence of fraud.
As a result, this office has found that it will be difficult to demonstrate to
the complainants that Texas elections are free from fraud and, thereby, free
local election officials from suspicion.&quot; [14]</p>

<p>Further investigations followed by both the office of the attorney general
and the office of the secretary of state (the latter included Ms. Gladney's
office). On September 23, 1986, the <u>Dallas Morning News</u> reported the
following story:</p>

<p>&quot;The state attorney general's and secretary of state's offices are
investigating discrepancies found in the computerized voting records of several
recent Dallas and state elections to determine if the results may have been
obtained fraudulently...</p>

<p>&quot;The probe centers on allegations that computerized voting equipment
and computer programs used to tabulate state and local elections may have been
tampered with to bring about 'preprogrammed results,' [Attorney General Jim]
Mattox said....</p>

<p>&quot;Terry Elkins, who managed [Max] Goldblatt's [1985] bid against
[incumbent Mayor of Dallas Starke] Taylor, said ... that she has given to state
officials 18 months of research documenting the discrepancies [in the 1985
mayor's race]. Chief among the discrepancies, she said is a claim that there
were more votes cast than there were voters' signatures.</p>

<p>&quot;'The allegation is that the computer used to count the votes was given
new instructions after it calculated that Max Goldblatt was leading Starke
Taylor by 400 votes,' Mrs. Elkins said.&quot; [15]</p>

<p>(Note: A detailed discussion of vote-tallying problems in the Dallas 1985
mayoralty election is given in section 4.3.)</p>

<p>The following day, September 24, 1986, the <u>Dallas Times Herald</u>
reported this additional information:</p>

<p>&quot;[Attorney General] Mattox said [on September 23] that the
investigations call into question the ability of local city and county
elections officials to vouch for the integrity of their elections when they use
the automatic vote-tallying system.</p>

<p>&quot;The punch card system, which uses a computer to count ballots marked
by voters, is so complex that election fraud could go unnoticed, Mattox said.</p>

<p>&quot;'I would say that the system appears not to have the kind of
safeguards that election authorities would like to have to give them the
independent capability to judge whether there has been fraud in an election,'
he said.</p>

<p>&quot;'It would not be easy even for a computer expert to determine that
there was fraud,' he said.&quot; [16]</p>

<p>2.8.2 Texas Secretary of State's Directive</p>

<p>As a result of the uncertainties created by the charges of vote fraud, and
the ensuing investigations, the Secretary of State of Texas issued a directive
on October 14, 1986 detailing additional security procedures for computerized
vote-tallying to be used by county clerks and election administrators. The
provisions of the directive were directly responsive to identified deficiencies
in vote-counting procedures. Some of the provisions are as follows:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;Under no circumstances may the
computer-generated printed log of computer activity that occurs during the
tabulation be turned off. The log must record all operator commands and inputs
to the system from any device. The log must indicate for each precinct the
to-tal number of ballots that are entered into the central computer.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;Each page of the log must reflect the
correct time of day.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;Each [of at least three cumulative reports
produced throughout the tabulation process] shall include ...the number of over
votes and under votes in each race.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;... a computer-generated report that
indicates the number of ballots cast in each precinct [shall be prepared].</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;... the secretary of state may order a
manual count of ballots cast in the election to ensure the accuracy of the

<p>2.8.3 Legislative Hearings</p>

<p>On November 25, 1986, the Texas House of Representatives Committee on
Elections, chaired by Representative Clint Hackney, held a hearing on possible
changes in the election laws of Texas related to computerized vote tallying.
Statements made by testifiers concerning the general problems of computerized
voting included the following, by the indicated individuals:</p>

<p>Dr. Michael Ian Shamos, computer scientist, and one of three statutory
examiners of electronic voting systems for the Pennsylvania Bureau of
Elections:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;Punched-card systems have two significant
positive features. One is that they cause a permanent physical record to be
kept of every ballot cast....A second positive aspect is that cards can be
counted very rapidly.... </p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;...punched-card systems have no other
redeeming features and in fact present great dangers. These are[:]</p>

<p>&quot;...the ballot itself contains no candidate names and is meaningless
when examined. This problem greatly increases voter confusion....</p>

<p>&quot;The voter is unable to determine whether he has cast a complete ballot
or whether he may have voted for more candidates that he is entitled. An
overvote will result in an invalid ballot, and the voter's legitimate choices
will go uncounted....</p>

<p>&quot;It is a straightforward matter to alter a punched-card voting booth so
that votes cast for one candidate will be recorded as though they were for
another....Any required tampering can be performed during the election and all
traces removed before any investigation can occur....</p>

<p>&quot;....the computer hardware and software used to tabulate the ballots is
subject to tampering. Furthermore, such tampering is relatively easy and
invisible....Computers can be manipulated remotely, by wire or radio, or by
direct physical input. The memories on which these computers operate can easily
fit into a shirt pocket and can be substituted in seconds. The software can be
set to await the receipt of a special card, whose presence will cause all the
election counters to be altered. This card could be dropped into the ballot box
by any confederate. The possibilities for this type of tampering are endless,
and virtually no detection is possible once tabulation has been completed....</p>

<p>&quot;Even if the software is not altered, there is no reason to believe
that it is correct. Many tests performed on such programs have revealed faulty
logic and wildly incorrect results.... Many jurisdictions, such as
Pennsylvania, have complex rules for counting such situations as cross-filed
candidates in vote-for-many offices and it is stretching to believe that an
election system vendor would be aware of all such combinations of conditions to
have produced perfect software. It is axiomatic in the computer industry that
all large computer programs contain errors, and the more extensive the software
the more errors it contains....</p>

<p>&quot;When one company or a conglomerate of companies supply unauditable
software from a central distribution point, or participate directly in ballot
setup procedures, there exists the possibility of large-scale tampering with
elections. An errant programmer or tainted executive could influence or
determine the outcome of a majority of election precincts in the
country....&quot; [18]</p>

<p>Ms. Suzan N. Kesim, vice-president of a security consulting firm of South
Bend, Indiana:</p>

<p>&quot;The program for counting elections should use structured programming
techniques. A detailed flow chart of the program should be required [to be
submitted]....</p>

<p>&quot;Whether you are adding dollars or votes, you can apply many of the
same auditing standards.... Many of the computer auditing procedures used by
the banking industry that have been tried and true could easily be modified or
used as they are for auditing elections....</p>

<p>&quot;Pre-punching the ballots with the precinct could be a really crucial
way of checking and making sure that ballots don't slide from precinct to
precinct....</p>

<p>&quot;Fraud possibilities include 'hidden programs'....</p>

<p>&quot;Write a public domain software program to count votes, open to public
scrutiny....&quot; [19]</p>

<p>Anita Rodeheaver, County Clerk, Harris County (Houston), Texas:</p>

<p>&quot;A computer, whether it is in a bank or a hospital or a collection
agency, or being used for elections, is only as good as the people that run
it....</p>

<p>&quot;It upsets me when continually we work so hard to have good honest
elections and we continually get hit with things that could happen or
'supposedly are happening,' but no one ever comes up with any concrete evidence
that they did happen....&quot; [20]</p>

<p>Tom Eschberger, Vice-President of Business Records Corp.:</p>

<p>&quot;In twenty years, I have seen two cases of attempted fraud on an
election system. I saw one in Albuquerque, New Mexico on lever machines, and
one in Pueblo, Colorado attempted on punch cards. I have personally run about
one thousand elections around the country.... Those were the only two cases
where I was convinced that somebody had tried to defraud somebody.</p>

<p>&quot;I have seen a lot of cases where people make dumb mistakes, where the
totals don't add up.... Elections are run by amateurs. [Other than experienced
election administrators,] there are 400 people out in the precincts who got
just a one-hour training class. People are not going to have perfect elections.
People are going to have the best elections that well-intentioned honest people
can run, and that well-intentioned honest companies can run....</p>

<p>&quot;A lot of counties want us to do the programming for them because it
disassociates them from any candidate and any accusation of fraud or
collusion.... [Persons intending to commit fraud would] have to have our source
code, they would have to have collusion with somebody in the county, they would
have to have access to the computer....</p>

<p>&quot;[Filing the program with the secretary of state] might set some minds
at ease. Then, someone could look at the code and know what's going on in an
election if there were a problem. If someone said there was fraud and here's
how they did it, then you have someone at the State level who is familiar with
our source code that could say yes or no. Yes, it would be beneficial from that
standpoint.&quot; [21]</p>

<p>Warner Croft, a partner in the public accounting firm of Arthur Anderson and
Company:</p>

<p>&quot;We do believe the election laws need to be codified to reflect the
technology being employed today in the election process.</p>

<p>&quot;We do believe that the Secretary of State needs to have the authority
and the money to enforce those laws, to make sure that the proper audit trails
are in place, so that whenever allegations do surface, ... the records are in
place so that the State can, with a minimum of time and effort, go to those
records and find out what happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately, the laws at this time are a bit too nebulous for that
to be done....</p>

<p>&quot;As long as there are winners and losers in elections, regardless of
the system being used, there will be these allegations. You cannot legislate
this problem away by requiring a higher generation of technology, another
language.</p>

<p>&quot;But what we can do is require an audit trail, so that the documents
that represent the voter's intent are kept on file, for a predefined minimum
period of time, so that no matter what went on inside the computer, we've got a
source that we can go back to, to determine what the voter actually
did....&quot; [22]</p>

<p>2.8.4 Revised Texas Statute on Electronic Voting Systems</p>

<p>A revised statute on the use of electronic voting systems was passed by the
Texas legislature and was approved in June, 1987 [23]. It took effect on September
1 of that year. Some of the revisions concerned the following topics:</p>

<p><u>Auditing</u>: A voting system may not be used unless it is capable of
providing records from which the operation of the system may be audited.</p>

<p><u>Deposit and Comparison of the Program</u>: Copies of the &quot;program
codes&quot; and related documentation must be filed with the secretary of
state. The secretary of state must periodically compare the materials on file
with those materials actually used to ensure that only approved materials are
used. The software on file is not public information, although it may be made
available to the attorney general for investigation of irregularities.</p>

<p><u>Use of Remote Terminals</u>: Computer terminals located outside the
central counting station must be capable of &quot;inquiry functions only&quot;
during vote tabulation, and &quot;no modem access to the tabulation
equipment&quot; must be available during tabulation.</p>

<p><u>Testing of Equipment</u>: Each unit of tabulating equipment shall be
tested &quot;using all applicable ballot formats.&quot;</p>

<p><u>Discrepancies in Ballot Totals</u>: If, in the use of a precinct-located
computer, a discrepancy of more than three exists between the number of ballots
recorded by the computer and the number of ballots written down by the precinct
officials, the final count of that precinct shall be done centrally.</p>

<p><u>Manual Count</u>: A manual count of all the races in one percent of the
election precincts, but in no less than three precincts, shall be conducted at
the local level. The secretary of state also may conduct a manual or automatic
count of any number of ballots. No specific ground for obtaining an initial
recount is required.</p>

<p>As a result of passage of the revised statute, all electronic voting systems
now certified for use in Texas will need to be decertified. The revised statute
specifically addresses some of the problems of computerized vote-tallying
identified immediately below.</p>

<p>2.9 <u>Current Problems Of Computerized Vote-Tallying<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Current problems of computerized vote-tallying, including those identified
by those who have recently made public statements or produced public documents,
are summarized by the following categorizations. The relationship of the
recommendations of this report to these problems is discussed in section 6.18.</p>

<p>2.9.1 Difficulty in Verifying Results</p>

<p>Results of elections announced by election officials are difficult to
verify. The problem of verifying results is due to:</p>

<p>(a) lack of audit trails;</p>

<p>(b) poor design of computer programs;</p>

<p>(c) vendor-supplied computer programs that are unavailable to the scrutiny
of responsible officials;</p>

<p>(d) administrative procedures that are incomplete and poorly implemented,
resulting, for example, in the inability of observers to successfully compare
computer reports of ballots cast with the same data reported by precinct
officials.</p>

<p>2.9.2 Possibility of Undiscoverable Frauds</p>

<p>The lack of internal controls and failure to implement computer security
increase the possibilities that unknown persons may perpetrate undiscoverable
frauds. Methods of forcing incorrect results include:</p>

<p>(a) fraudulent alterations in the computer program or in control cards that
manipulate the program;</p>

<p>(b) activation of a hidden program, possibly by means of a time-of-day match
or with a specially encoded punch card ballot;</p>

<p>(c) manual replacement of the computer program by a fraudulent substitute;</p>

<p>(d) introduction of false ballots into the set of real ballots, through
either addition or replacement; or introduction of false ballot data through
interchange of ballots, by a perpetrator taking advantage of different ballot
styles; </p>

<p>(e) introduction of false voting summaries through changes in data stored in
removable data storage units of precinct-located, vote-counting devices;</p>

<p>(f) fraudulent alteration of the face of the voting device used by the voter
at the polling location to mark a ballot or indicate choices;</p>

<p>(g) fraudulent alteration of the logic of precinct-located, vote-counting
devices.</p>

<p>2.9.3 Election Administrators' Lack of Knowledge and Resources </p>

<p>Some election administrators have a lack of knowledge about computers, and
they lack the necessary knowledge and resources to effectively negotiate with
vendors. The effect of these deficiencies are:</p>

<p>(a) administrative errors in conducting elections, with increased potential
for fraud or, at minimum, loss of public confidence;</p>

<p>(b) abdication of control over elections to vendors and county data
processors, with the resultant inability to impose the necessary internal
controls;</p>

<p>(c) inability to require vendors to provide computer programs, election
equipment and supplies that include adequate safeguards against fraud and
inaccurate reporting;</p>

<p>(d) increased risk to vendors in entering a market fraught with the
potential for negative publicity, resulting in reduced competition and reduced
investment in improved products;</p>

<p>(e) slower than adequate introduction of more effective technology.</p>

<p><b>3. <u>TYPES OF VOTE-TALLYING SYSTEMS, THEIR VULNERABILITIES, AND THEIR
NATIONAL DISTRIBUTION<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p>3.1 <u>Vote-Tallying As Part Of Voting<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Voting, as it is carried out in the United States today, may be said to
consist of four distinct administrative steps. These are: </p>

<p>(1) voter authorization: the determination of whether the prospective voter
is entitled to vote at a particular place, and for what set of offices and
issues; </p>

<p>(2) secret choice: provision of the opportunity for the voter to express his
or her choices without intimidation: </p>

<p>(3) precise recording of the expression of each voter's choices in a
voter-disconnected and easily countable format; and (4) accurate summarization
of all voters' choices by candidate and issue alternative. </p>

<p>Vote-tallying, a subset of voting, consists of steps (3) and (4), although
the process involves concern for steps (1) and (2).</p>

<p>3.2 <u>Paper Ballots<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The uniform use of an official ballot containing the names of all
candidates, printed on uniform paper by public officers at public expense, and
distributed only at the polls where it is marked in secret, was adopted first
in the Australian state of Victoria in 1856. In the years immediately
following, the concept was adopted in other Australian states. Thus, it came to
be called the &quot;Australian ballot&quot; [24]. The Australian ballot concept
was the first successful attempt to meet the requirements of steps (2) and (3)
above.</p>

<p>The Australian ballot had its first U.S. statewide application in New York
in 1889, and was adopted widely throughout the Nation in the next decades.
Prior to that, the application of the secret ballot was limited. In many cases,
persons had to announce their votes publicly, or tell them to a sheriff who
recorded them. In other cases, there were party-specific paper ballots,
produced with different colors or weights of paper to reveal party choice.</p>

<p>During the early years of introduction of the Australian ballot, there was
considerable controversy over whether the information on the ballots should be
arranged in a &quot;party&quot; format (the set of all candidates of a single
party listed together), or in an &quot;office&quot; format (the set of all
candidates for a single office listed together). At present, most ballots are
designed with an &quot;office&quot; format. However, in many states, voters are
permitted to select all candidates of a particular party with a single
&quot;straight party&quot; vote, with an allowance for &quot;crossover&quot;
votes for specific candidates of any other party.</p>

<p>Paper ballots remain in use today in small communities and rural areas by
about eleven percent of U.S. registered voters (see section 3.9.2 for the
percentage of use of the various system types by counties and by registered voters).</p>

<p>3.2.1 Vulnerabilities of Paper Ballots</p>

<p>When effective administrative controls are not applied, paper ballots are
subject to possible fraud and error in their distribution, in their use at
polling places, and in counting.</p>

<p><u>Ballot frauds</u>: Failure to properly account for ballots distributed
may provide the opportunity for fraudulent addition of extra ballots into the
ballot box, an activity generally referred to as &quot;ballot stuffing.&quot;
In places where votes are bought and real ballots are not sufficiently
distinctive, voters may be handed pre-voted counterfeit ballots before entering
the polling place. As an alternative fraud, voted counterfeit ballots may be
substituted for real ballots already voted.</p>

<p><u>Chain voting</u>: When administrative controls at the polling location
are poorly implemented, and enough voters are willing, chain voting is a
possibility. In chain voting, the first voter in the chain retains the unnoted
ballot given to him at the polling place and, instead of voting, takes the
ballot outside. This voter loses his vote, but starts the chain. Outside, a
party worker fills out the ballot and hands it to a second voter who has also
agreed to participate. The second voter turns in the voted ballot, but retains
the unnoted ballot handed to him in the polling place for return to the party
worker outside. Successive voters who participate receive a pre-voted ballot
and return an unnoted ballot to the party worker.</p>

<p><u>Malicious invalidation</u>: In counting paper ballots, extra marks may be
made on ballots intended for an opposition candidate, thereby subjecting those
ballots to invalidation in jurisdictions where extra marks are cause for that
result. (Extra marks are often cause for invalidation because such marks may be
used to indicate that a private agreement has been carried out in which a voter
has agreed to vote as instructed in return for some consideration.)</p>

<p><u>Inaccurate counting</u>: Hand counting of large numbers of paper ballots
is generally inaccurate, because of human inattention and fatigue, compared with
counting of machine-readable ballots.</p>

<p>3.3 <u>Lever Machines<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The first use of mechanical lever-type voting machines was in Lockport, New
York in 1892 [25]. In the use of these types of machines, hereinafter referred
to as &quot;lever machines,&quot; each candidate or issue alternative is
assigned a particular lever of a rectangular array of levers on the face of the
machine that is seen by the voter. The levers are horizontal in their unnoted
positions. The array of levers may be arranged with offices from right-to-left
and parties from top-to-bottom, or vice-versa. A set of inserted printed strips
visible to the voter identifies the lever assignments.</p>

<p>On entering the area of the machine (the &quot;voting booth&quot;), the
voter enables the machine with a handle that also closes a privacy curtain.
Then, in order to indicate choices, the voter pulls down selected levers. When
the voter exits the voting booth by opening the privacy curtain with the
handle, the levers are automatically returned to their original positions. As
each lever returns, it causes a connected counter wheel within the machine to
turn one-tenth of a full rotation. The counter wheel, serving as the
&quot;units&quot; position of the numerical vote count for the associated
lever, drives a &quot;tens&quot; counter one-tenth of a rotation for each of
its full rotations. The &quot;tens&quot; counter similarly drives a
&quot;hundreds&quot; counter. If all the mechanical connections are fully
operational during the voting period, and the counters are initially set to
zero, the position of each counter at the end of the voting period indicates
the number of votes that were cast on the lever that drives it.</p>

<p>By 1930, lever machines had been installed in Denver, Milwaukee,
Minneapolis, Newark, New York City, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and San Francisco
[26]. One reason for the acceptance of the machines was the existence of
significant fraud in the use of paper ballots. By the middle 1960s, just before
the introduction of punch card voting, almost all large cities and many
medium-sized ones used lever machines. It is likely that, at that time, over
one-half the votes in the Nation were being cast on lever machines (now
slightly more than one-third).</p>

<p>Lever machines are precinct-located devices, that is, the basic vote-count
is accomplished at a neighborhood voting location that may be remote from the
place where the votes are summarized to determine the outcomes of the contests.
The number of machines at each location depends on the number of persons
expected to vote there and the expected average time for a person to cast a
complete set of votes. Separate machines may be required for each party in a
primary election (conceivably, only part of the machine could be made operable
for a voter of a specific party, with another part reserved for another party)
and for each precinct voting at the same location.</p>

<p>3.3.1 Summarizing Lever Machine Results</p>

<p>After the close of the polls, the backs of the machines are opened. The
number of votes is read off each of the counters, and each number is
transcribed to official documents. Recently manufactured lever machines may
allow for printing of the counter values on request. The official precinct
documents are carried to the central vote-counting location for summarization.</p>

<p>With lever machines, only summarized voting results are available at the
precinct level. No individual choices are available to be counted. Interlocks
in the machines prevent overcoming (voting for more than the allowed number of
candidates in a contest, e.g., voting for three candidates in a vote-for-two
contest, such as for school board). There can be undervotes (voting for less
than the allowed number of candidates in a contest, e.g., voting for one or no
candidate in a vote-for-two situation).</p>

<p>3.3.2 Vulnerabilities of Lever Machines</p>

<p>With a lever machine, there is no ballot, i.e., no independent verification
of each machine's recorded result. While the lack of ballots eliminates the
possibility of chain voting, counterfeit ballots, and spoiling of the
opponent's ballots, there are other possibilities for fraud or error, some
available because there are no ballots.</p>

<p><u>Vote count frauds</u>: The lever-machine equivalent to &quot;ballot
stuffing&quot; is the casting of extra votes on the machine by party workers.
When there is no genuine bipartisan staffing of a precinct polling place, any
type of vote-tallying system is more easily subjected to fraud.</p>

<p><u>No audit trail of voter's intent</u>: One effect of the unavailability of
ballots is the lack of a true audit trail. No unequivocal distinction between
an undervote and a machine failure can be made solely with a review of the vote
counts. If the number of votes cast for an office is less than the number of
persons that have voted on the machine (often indicated by a &quot;public
counter&quot; that may be connected to the voting handle), then for each undervote,
there are the following possibilities for a contest involving two candidates:
either the voter failed to vote for either candidate, or the counter mechanism
failed to turn for the voter's choice. </p>

<p>In general, it is not possible to determine which one of these possibilities
is the correct one for any single undervote without a review of the internal
condition of the machine. If a counter mechanism failed to turn, it may be due
to an actual disconnect in the mechanical system, or it may be due to excessive
friction in the connections. If a vote total reads 000 or some number up to 009
when many more might have been expected, a mechanical disconnect is a strong
possibility. If a vote total reads 009 or 099, the possibility is increased
that excessive friction at the point of highest mechanical resistance to
turning (during an arithmetic carry operation) caused a failure. If the counter
failed to turn correctly for any reason, there is no independent ballot
available to verify the count. The voter's choices are lost, absent a court
order for a new election.</p>

<p><u>No true recount capability</u>: In a lever machine contest, a
&quot;recount&quot; simply means that the precinct transcriptions are reviewed
to determine if any precinct official erred in copying down the counter values
or the precinct documents were fraudulently replaced on the way to the central
summarization location.</p>

<p><u>Write-in difficulty</u>: Another problem with lever machines is the
difficulty of indicating write-in votes. The lever machine is not oriented
towards individual idiosyncratic choice, but only choice from the available
menu. If State or local law requires it, a roll of paper is made available with
the machine for use by a voter in writing a name not available on a lever.
However, the selection and use of this mechanism is noisy, and it is obvious to
those around the voting area that a write-in vote is in progress. Since only a
small number of voters may choose this possibility, privacy may be completely
lost by those individuals in that instance.</p>

<p><u>Mis-labeling</u>: A possibility for error or deliberate fraud is the
insertion of incorrect identifying strips on the front of the machine, so that
the levers are mis-identified to the voters.</p>

<p><u>Storage and transport</u>: Lever machines are large and heavy, and
therefore difficult to transport and expensive to store (compared with
precinct-located electronic machines). </p>

<p><u>Setup errors or frauds</u>: &quot;Programming,&quot; i.e., pre-election
setup with interlocks, requires specialized knowledge and is labor-intensive.
Furthermore, the necessary specialized knowledge is not directly translatable
to a variety of other work, for the support of the machine technicians between
elections. As with any other situation where specialized knowledge may be
employed for honest or dishonest purposes, the possibility of collusion
involving lever-machine &quot;programmers&quot; must be considered.</p>

<p><u>Difficulty in operability verification</u>: It is difficult to
statistically test the correct operation of a lever machine by applying a large
number of test votes. A lever machine is operated by direct human action, and
the use of human labor to insert a statistically significant number of test
votes to each counter would be expensive and error-prone. To effectively
accomplish a statistical test of correct operation, a mechanism would need to
be constructed that could vote on each lever a large number of times with an
electromechanical drive that could be programmed. The mechanism would check the
following: the single-vote recording operation of each counter, proper
implementation of vote-for-more-than-one setups, overvote prevention, and
proper operation of the arithmetic carry mechanism.</p>

<p>3.4 <u>Punch Card Voting<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Voting systems based on punch card ballots began to be used in the middle
1960s, and received considerable application in the western part of the U.S. by
1972. At that time, about 10% of U.S. voters used punch card ballots to record
their choices [27] (but now, almost 45% use one of the two principal types of
cards).</p>

<p>The introduction of punch card voting was an economic choice of many
communities in their efforts to provide election services to an expanding
population. Voting with punch cards does not require serial processing of many
voters through a single voting station containing a complex machine. Several
voting stations may be made available in one precinct with much less expense.</p>

<p>In the late 1960s and 1970s, punch card input of data to mainframe computers
was commonplace. Punch card stock and punch card reader technology were widely
available. American national standards, developed to specify the size of the
cards [28] and the arrangement of holes in each card [29], were available to be
adopted for punch cards used in voting.</p>

<p>The standard punch card has 960 potential punch locations arranged in 80
columns by 12 rows. In common business use, each column on a card represents
one character (such as a letter of the alphabet or decimal digit). A standard
data code for business use of the punch card has been developed, and it is
called the Hollerith code [30]. In this code and in its recent extensions, a
graphic character (a character seen in printed text) typically requires no more
than three holes in a column to represent it. For each unique character, the
holes representing it form a correspondingly unique pattern. When the pattern
of holes in the twelve locations in one column is read by a card reader and
converted to a sequence of 1s and 0s in a computer (e.g., 1 for a hole and 0
for no hole), the sequence may be recognized as the unique character by a
computer program.</p>

<p>When the standard punch card is to be used to record votes, it is necessary
to permit more variability in the use of punch locations than the Hollerith
coding system allows. When any number and arrangement of holes in a single
column are permitted, the coding system is called &quot;column binary.&quot;
However, not every location on the card can be used for voting. This
restriction is generally due to ballot layout considerations, but some
consideration must be given to the physical strength of the card when it is
used with more intensive layouts. A further limitation on the use of punch
locations is necessary if information about the candidates and issue choices is
to be printed on the card.</p>

<p>3.4.1 Vulnerabilities of Punch Card Use</p>

<p>Punch card ballots have all of the vulnerabilities of paper ballots that are
related to distribution, precinct use, and collection. Administrative controls
may be implemented to prevent the typical paper ballot frauds. Most of these
controls have been previously identified [1], and are proposed again in section
6.16.</p>

<p><u>Manufacturing requirements</u>: Accurate dimensioning in manufacturing,
and use of materials consistent with the needs of punch card readers, are
additional requirements unnecessary for paper ballots.</p>

<p><u>Ballot-reader requirements</u>: Accurate ballot reading is of fundamental
importance in a punch card system. Assurance should be obtained, in both
pre-election and post-election checkout, that the readers are correctly reading
the ballots. In addition to the question of accurate recording of voters'
selections, difficulties in ballot processing may include card jams, transport
of more than one ballot at a time, and the inherent problem of pre-scored
cards. If a card jams in the reader, it is essential to know whether or not the
card was counted; otherwise, either the card and its votes may be counted
twice, or not at all. Transport of more than one ballot, similarly, may cause a
miscount of the cards as well as inaccurate reading. (The reader can accurately
read only one ballot at a time.) The problem of pre-scored cards is considered
in sections 3.4.3 and 3.4.4.</p>

<p>3.4.2 Types of Punch Cards</p>

<p>Two common types of punch cards used for voting may be distinguished. These
are designated in popular usage as the &quot;votomatic&quot; card type and the
&quot;datavote&quot; card type. As used by a voter, a card of either type is
positioned with the long edges on the right and left, and the short edges at
the top and bottom. Thus, each column is horizontal, and each row is vertical.
The card is usually issued to the voter with a numbered stub attached to the
top short edge. The line of attachment is perforated for easy removal of the
stub. In most cases, the stub is removed immediately before the ballot is
submitted; it may be removed by a precinct official while the voter's choices are
covered by an envelope or other holder. One use of the number on the stub is to
assure that the ballot voted is the same one issued to the voter.</p>

<p><u>&quot;Votomatic&quot; card</u>: With the &quot;votomatic&quot; card, the
locations at which holes may be made to indicate votes are assigned numbers.
The number of each hole is the only information printed on the card. This type
of card maximizes the number of voting locations available. As there is no
space on the card for names, names of write-in candidates must be written by
the voter on the envelope provided to the voter with the card. In the tallying
process, each envelope must be examined before the card is removed; each card
and its envelope with write-ins must be put aside for separate processing. The
envelopes with write-ins cannot be separated from their ballot cards until the
cards are reviewed for overvotes.</p>

<p>In the 312-position &quot;votomatic&quot; card, every third column is used,
beginning with column 5 and ending with column 80. This allows for 26 usable
columns which, when combined with 12 rows per column, provides for 312
positions. There are also 228-position and 235-position cards available. Only
one side of the &quot;votomatic&quot; card is used. The &quot;votomatic&quot;
card (when separated from any attached stub) is generic for any election, as it
only has numbers on it.</p>

<p><u>&quot;Datavote&quot; card</u>: With the &quot;datavote&quot; card, the
name of the candidate or description of the issue choice is printed on the card
next to the location at which the hole is to be punched to indicate the choice.
Fewer voting locations are available on the &quot;datavote&quot; card. However,
the &quot;datavote&quot; card provides a particularly simple write-in
capability, as a separate blank candidate line in each contest may be provided
for that purpose.</p>

<p>For the &quot;datavote&quot; type card, the locations used for voting are in
a row close to the righthand long edge of the card. Spacing of two or more
columns between voting locations is required to allow room for the printing of
the candidate name or issue choice description. Typically, the card may be
turned over (with its long dimension as an axis) so that the other long edge is
on the right. Then, the other side of the card and a row close to the second
long edge may also be used to provide voting locations.</p>

<p>3.4.3 Voting With the &quot;Votomatic&quot; Card</p>

<p>A voter uses the &quot;votomatic&quot; card for voting by first inserting it
(with its attached end stub) in a hollow mechanical holder. (The holder is
often called a &quot;votomatic device&quot; or &quot;vote recorder.&quot;) The
stub contains two holes. The card is properly positioned when the holes in the
stub are fitted over two small posts on the device. The holes are asymmetrical
in the stub to prevent the voter from inserting the card so as to show its
reverse side. The system was developed from a concept introduced by Dr. Joseph
P. Harris, whose early book on election administration has been previously
referenced [24], [25], [26].</p>

<p>Compared with the lever machine, the mechanical holder is inexpensive. Many
more holders could be used in a precinct for the same cost, and therefore, more
voters may simultaneously vote. </p>

<p>A hinged booklet is attached to the mechanical holder. The booklet is
attached so that it is centered over the inserted punch card. The pages of the
booklet are crimped to a hinge, as it is necessary that the pages not be
removed during the voting process. The attachment permits the exposure of only
one row of the punch card to the view of the voter at the axis of the booklet.
As the pages are turned, a different row of the punch card is exposed for each
page. All voting instructions, such as office names, candidate names, candidate
punch positions, and allowable number of votes per office, are presented on the
pages. (In some cases, the pages are simply transparent envelopes and the
ballot information is provided on inserts within the envelopes. In those cases,
the envelopes are sealed following insertion of the ballot information.) The
names of the candidates and issue choices must be positioned on the pages so
that each is next to the appropriate voting location on the card.</p>

<p>A vote is cast by creation of a hole in the punch card at the desired
location. Almost all unnoted &quot;votomatic&quot; cards are pre-scored, i.e.,
each voting location on the unnoted card is scored in the shape of a rectangle.
Sufficient pressure on the voting location with a hand-held stylus forces out
the inside of the rectangle, identified as a piece of &quot;chad.&quot; The
need for pre-scoring is due to the simple nature of the stylus and the
inability of the voter to otherwise form a hole of the dimensions required for
processing through a ballot reader.</p>

<p>Recently, a new type of stylus has been introduced: one which does not
require a pre-scored card. The new stylus has a spring-loaded sleeve. The
sleeve provides sufficient force to punch out pieces of round chad with a
diameter acceptable for processing, without the need for pre-scoring. The new
stylus is used with the same type of &quot;votomatic&quot; ballot holding
device as that used for pre-scored cards, but with a change in the device's
internal construction. Precise manufacturing of the new internal
&quot;templates&quot; that guide the stylus is required. This type of system
has been used successfully in St. Lucie County, Florida. St. Lucie has about
400 ballot holder units constructed for use with the new stylus.</p>

<p>3.4.4 Vulnerabilities of the &quot;Votomatic&quot; System</p>

<p>Some vulnerabilities that are special to the &quot;votomatic&quot; system
include the following: the lack of candidate information on the card itself,
the need of the voter to turn over all the pages of the booklet to get all
available voting information, possible misalignment of the candidate
information on the page with the appropriate voting location on the card, the
possibility of malicious alteration in the voting instructions on the pages,
and the problem of chad in pre-scored cards.</p>

<p><u>Lack of candidate information on the card</u>: The fact that the
&quot;votomatic&quot; card only has numbers on it results in a lack of an
obvious relationship to the candidate selected, once the voted card is removed
from the mechanical holding device. However, each hole is numbered, and the
instructions on the pages identify each candidate and issue choice by the
corresponding hole number. In jurisdictions that use the system, campaign
advertising may specify the hole number of the desired choice (although
rotation of candidate sequence in different districts prevents candidates
running in multiple districts from having a universal card location). </p>

<p>In absentee voting, the voter typically does not have a ballot holder
available. The voter must find the number of the candidate or issue choice
desired as listed on the instructions, find the number on the ballot that
matches the number of the candidate, and punch out the corresponding chad.</p>

<p>Clearly, the system is not as user-friendly as a ballot or display
containing the candidate names, on which each vote is cast next to the desired
name, but the &quot;votomatic&quot; system may have been selected because of
economy, or the presence of a very long list of contests, for which no viable
alternative voting system exists. In California, each voter receives a sample
ballot in the mail. Knowledgeable persons in that state believe that this
procedure significantly improves the voter's ability to correctly use the
system.</p>

<p><u>Need to turn over all pages</u>: The voter must turn over all the pages
of the booklet to obtain all necessary instructions and to permit each voting
location to be available for punching. Some voters may forget to do this and
lose their franchise for some contests and issues. When the number of
candidates for a single office is very large, the voter may be forced to look
on successive pages to find the total list. Confusion about voting for such a
contest may result. If the &quot;votomatic&quot; system is selected for other
compelling reasons, voter education is the only method of assuring voter
understanding of the voting process.</p>

<p><u>Failure of information alignment</u>: If assembly of the mechanical
holder and the booklet is inaccurate, or the location of printing on the pages
is imprecise, the candidate information on the pages may not correspond exactly
to the appropriate voting location. Voter confusion, about which hole to punch,
will result.</p>

<p><u>Malicious alteration of instructions</u>: It has been charged (see
section 2.8.3) that the instructions on the pages might be altered by a
particular voter, to the detriment of voters who follow and use the same
mechanical holder. Even if the holder could not be easily taken apart by a
voter and the pages replaced, certainly the instructions could be defaced or
covered over with a stick-on label that supplies false instructions. A defense
against this is alertness on the part of the precinct officials, but there are
other defenses in place. One defense is that the perpetrator will have given
his verified name and address. Secondly, the perpetrator may be observed if
there is no privacy curtain; or a following voter may note the defacement or
alteration, thus limiting the possible perpetrators to a small number. In
addition, since many mechanical holder units are employed in a typical
election, the damage done will have a very small effect, unless a massive
conspiracy attacking many such units can be assembled.</p>

<p><u>Problem of chad in pre-scored cards</u>: Pre-scored cards have presented
some difficulties in processing. Either a chad may fall out unintentionally, or
a chad that is intended for removal may not be fully removed. In either case,
the voter's intent is not accurately recorded.</p>

<p>A chad that is not intended to fall out may be loosened in handling, or may
be loosened in the processing of the card through the card reader. Lack of care
in tearing off the stub of the card may loosen chad. Undesired removal of chad
in reading may be more likely if the design of the reader mechanism requires
the card to bend. If the card jams in the reader and is folded or bent, pieces
of chad may fall out. Training of precinct personnel in card handling and stub
removal, and careful selection of card readers, may alleviate this problem.</p>

<p>During voting, a piece of chad completely removed by the voter should fall
into the mechanical ballot holder and cause no difficulty. However, in some
cases, the voter fails to completely remove the chad. This problem may be due
to one or more of several factors, such as: (a) the mechanical holder may have
been constructed or assembled poorly, and the parts of the holder are not where
they should be, (b) the materials are of poor quality, or certain materials
used, e.g., rubber, may have deteriorated with time, (c) the voter may have
inserted the punch card incorrectly into the mechanical holder, (d) the voter may
attempt to punch out the chad with a less effective tool than the stylus, such
as a ball point pen, (e) the voter may apply insufficient force, because of a
physical infirmity or because the voter is unaware of the requirement for
complete chad removal, (f) the dimensions of the punch card may not be within
tolerances, or (g) the process of pre-scoring the card might have been done
poorly.</p>

<p>A partially removed chad may be pressed back into the card during the
stacking of the cards in preparation for reading, or during the reading itself.
If the chad is pressed back, no vote will be recorded for that location, even
if it was the intention of the voter to cast that vote. A chad that falls out
during the reading process may affect the operation of the reader. Some
election administrations provide &quot;inspection boards:&quot; bipartisan
panels of persons who review each card before processing, and who remove
hanging chad according to pre-established rules. This process also identifies
write-ins, and catches the occasional malicious action, such as the attachment
of chewing gum or other objects to a card. Extraneous objects may cause the
card to stick in the card reader, or possibly damage the reader mechanism. </p>

<p>3.4.5 Voting With the &quot;Datavote&quot; Card</p>

<p>For voting on the &quot;datavote&quot; card, a stapler-like tool is used.
The tool creates a hole instead of inserting a staple, and the tool provides
sufficient force such that pre-scoring of the card is unnecessary. In order for
the tool to be used, the card is placed in a holder which positions the row to
be punched under the hole-punching part of the tool. The tool is mounted on the
holder so that it can move up and down the row to the desired column. The
holder is inexpensive, so that several may be used at one voting location.</p>

<p>3.4.6 Vulnerabilities of the &quot;Datavote&quot; System</p>

<p>With the use of the hole-punching tool, there is no problem of hanging chad.
Since the candidate information is on the card, there is no potential for
malicious alteration of voting instructions.</p>

<p><u>Multiple cards</u>: As the &quot;datavote&quot; card provides fewer
voting locations than the &quot;votomatic&quot; card, even when both sides of
the &quot;datavote&quot; card are used, more than one &quot;datavote&quot; card
may need to be issued to a voter. Additional cards require a certain additional
expense. In using the &quot;datavote&quot; system, a voter may forget to turn
the card over, or forget to use the additional cards, thereby losing part of
the franchise. As with the problem of turning over the &quot;votomatic&quot;
pages, voter education appears to be the only antidote.</p>

<p>When the number of candidates for an office is very large, both sides of the
card may need to be used for the office. In rare cases, e.g., for voting for
delegates to certain national party conventions, more than one card may be
needed. In the latter case, all cards for the office from a single voter must
be kept together, to identify overcoming.</p>

<p><u>Processing of multiple cards</u>: When more than one &quot;datavote&quot;
card is issued to each voter, more time must be allotted for processing the
cards than for a single card per voter, or extra card reader capacity must be
added. </p>

<p>3.5 <u>Voting With A Mark-Sense Ballot<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>With this type of ballot, the voter makes a mark in a small rectangle or
circle on a ballot to indicate a vote, and after the ballot is handed in, it is
automatically read. Sensing systems originally employed electrical conductivity
to determine if a mark had been made, but it is now much more common for light
to be used. Thus, the system is often referred to as &quot;optical scan,&quot;
and is currently used by about seven and one-half percent of registered voters.
Mark-sense technology is widely used also in standardized testing, for example
for college entrance, and in statewide lotteries. </p>

<p>In the use of light as a sensor (or other part of the electromagnetic
spectrum, such as infra-red), the beam impinges on the voting location, and the
quality of the reflection of the beam is used to determine whether or not a
mark is present. With the system employing infra-red, the voter is not limited
to any particular writing instrument or pencil hardness, provided that the mark
is not colored red.</p>

<p>Mark-sense ballots are typically not designed in the size, proportions, or
thickness of the standard punch card. In most cases, they are larger, in order
to allow for the printing of candidate and issue choice information directly on
the ballot, while retaining just a single sheet as a ballot. As with the
&quot;datavote&quot; punch card, separate blank lines may allow for write-in
candidates. A numbered stub should be attached when issued, to permit proper
accounting. No special holding device is required for use by a voter.</p>

<p>3.5.1 Vulnerabilities of Mark-Sense Ballot Systems</p>

<p>Mark-sense ballots, like punch card ballots, have the same potential for
ballot manipulation frauds as paper ballots, and the same administrative
controls may be applied as countermeasures.</p>

<p><u>Ballot-reader and ballot requirements</u>: As with punch card ballots,
accuracy of the reader is fundamental. The reader must be sufficiently
sensitive to read the marks without being too sensitive so as to mistake
smudges for votes. Similarly, if ballots are automatically fed, readers must be
designed so as to transport only one ballot at a time. Jams of ballots in the
reader must be adequately dealt with to assure accurate counting. Furthermore,
printing of the basic control information (timing marks and voting locations)
on the ballot must be precise. The needed precision may increase printing
costs.</p>

<p><u>Treatment of reader-rejected ballots</u>: Some mark-sense readers appear
to have a problem in reading a fraction of the ballots (they provide a
&quot;go-no-go&quot; indication) without any differences between the read and
unread ballots being obvious to an observer. Ballots given a &quot;no-go&quot;
indication by the reader may be separated by the mechanism and returned to the input,
to allow for reentry. Rules for treatment of ballots unreadable by machine
should be instituted to ensure that each voter's choices are counted, if the
voter's intent can be determined (see section 4.9 for a pertinent example).</p>

<p>A positive feature of one reader implementation is that it returns the
uncounted ballot to the voter if the voter has overvoted any office, thereby
giving the voter a chance to eliminate the overvote.</p>

<p>3.6 <u>Precinct Versus Central Count For Machine-Readable Ballots<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>While voting on punch card and mark-sense ballots is carried out at precinct
locations, counting of the votes may be done either at the precincts or at a
central location. When voting with machine-readable ballots first started,
there were no micro-computers, and all counting was done centrally. With the
development of inexpensive small computers not requiring a special environment,
the possibility of precinct counting of ballots became viable. </p>

<p>The selection of precinct versus central count is often a political decision,
in which the desire for local control and decentralized decision-making is
traded off against the higher costs for procurement, maintenance and support of
many small machines. Local control appears to be important where there are
strong neighborhood political organizations that believe that producing the
tally locally, hopefully one that favors their party, assists in attracting
committed individuals to the cause. The ability to see the tally produced and
carry it to the central summarization location is seen as a reward for precinct
service.</p>

<p>With counting at the precincts, unofficial results, obtained from a small
removable storage unit of each machine, may be transmitted over telephone lines
or hand-carried to the central location, thereby providing a rapid indication
of the local outcomes. Los Angeles County, the largest local government
jurisdiction in population, continues to use central counting, while Chicago,
among our largest cities, uses precinct counting. In Chicago, summarized
precinct results on removable data storage devices are hand-carried to regional
centers, from which the data is transmitted over phone lines to a central
location.</p>

<p>3.6.1 Vulnerabilities of Precinct Count and Central Count</p>

<p>The selection of precinct count or central count is a trade-off in
vulnerabilities, as well as in other factors.</p>

<p><u>Central count</u>: Uncounted ballots must be transported to the central
location. The transportation of the ballots is an insecure process requiring
effective controls. </p>

<p>The centralization of counting provides additional vulnerabilities, in the
possible mixup of ballots from different precincts, and in computer operations.
Often, a &quot;header&quot; card is added to the top of each precinct deck of
ballot cards to be read. The use of &quot;header&quot; cards implies that the
complete instructions to the computer are not already in the program, but are
partially provided by these cards. Thus, it is important that the
&quot;header&quot; cards, as well as all operator instructions to the computer,
become part of the official records of the election. Backup computer components
must be available to prevent total breakdown in a central count system. (See
section 4.11 for an example of a partial breakdown.)</p>

<p><u>Precinct count</u>: Machines have to be transported to precinct polling
places at least one day before an election. These locations are relatively
insecure against a motivated and dedicated adversary. At the polling places,
there must be concern to prevent tampering as well as theft. A precinct-located
machine usually has an EPROM (erasable, programmable read-only memory) that is
inserted in it to specialize the machine for the particular ballot conditions
in that precinct. Particular care must be taken to protect the EPROM against
tampering, removal, accidental interchange with another EPROM, or replacement
with an EPROM containing incorrect data. The EPROM may be attached with a seal
to make tampering more difficult, and the EPROM may have data on it which will
make it operative only if it is inserted in the machine for which it is intended.</p>

<p>Transmission of precinct results over telephone lines to a central location
is a potentially inaccurate and insecure process requiring consideration of
controls. Transmission of results needs no special security if only unofficial
and summarized results are transmitted after the polls are closed, and
connections are made only from the central station outwards. Encryption should
be considered if individual choices or summarized results are to be transmitted
before the polls are closed, or if the transmitted data is considered to be
official. Other special hardware and software controls are required if dial-in
connections are to be made. A useful analysis of security controls that may be
used is available. [31] To assure accuracy of transmission, provision for
parity checks and retransmission in case of error should be included in the
communications equipment acquired for this purpose.</p>

<p>3.7 <u>Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) Machines<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>This type of machine, the newest entry in applying computer techniques to
voting, is an electronic implementation of the lever-machine concept. This
system type is currently used by slightly more than two and one-half percent of
U.S. registered voters.</p>

<p>As with a lever machine, there is no ballot; the possible choices are
visible to the voter on the front of the machine. The voter directly enters
choices into electronic storage in the machine with the use of a touch-screen,
or pushbuttons, or similar devices. If an alphabetic keyboard is provided with
the voter-choice entry device, write-in possibilities are significantly eased.</p>

<p>The voter's choices are stored in the machine and summed there with all
other voters' choices. At the close of polls, summaries from all machines are
then combined to yield final results. (If the machine simply produces a ballot
to be reviewed by the voter for correctness, and then the ballots are tallied
to produce the final count, the machine cannot be categorized as DRE.)</p>

<p>The determination of the number of individual DRE machines required at a
particular location requires the same type of considerations as for lever
machines. As a DRE machine essentially consists of a voter-choice entry station
and a computer to summarize choices, an implementation using several
voter-choice entry devices and one computer is possible. In the latter system,
several voters simultaneously use individual entry devices to record their
votes. Votes are summarized in a single computer installation that serves all
such devices at the precinct. </p>

<p>As with lever machines, overvotes are prevented on DRE machines, but
undervotes are permissible. In a typical machine, the voter's choices are
entered into a temporary storage unit. The storage unit controls a display,
visible only to the voter, of the choices made. With this feedback, the voter
is given some reason to believe that the desired choices have been entered
correctly into the temporary storage, but no independent proof can be provided
to the voter that the choices have, in fact, been entered correctly for the
purpose of summarizing those choices with all others to produce vote totals.</p>

<p>3.7.1 Summarization of DRE Machine Results</p>

<p>As a precinct-located machine, a DRE machine may have its results recorded
on a removable data storage device or on a printout or both. The printout or
device may be carried to a central station, or the data taken from the storage
device may be transmitted over telephone lines. As with precinct-located
ballot-tallying machines, there must be consideration of accuracy and security
controls over such transmissions.</p>

<p>3.7.2 Vulnerabilities of DRE Machines</p>

<p>While the DRE machine is an electronic implementation of the lever machine
concept, there is a significant distinction between them, other than their use
of different technology. To prepare for each election, each lever machine is
separately and individually set up (although several may be set up by the same
technician). </p>

<p><u>Centralization of setup</u>: Each DRE machine in an election receives its
EPROM for set up from a single central source (the same as precinct-located
ballot-tallying machines). In addition, the instructions on the face of the
machine may be similarly produced centrally by computer. This centralization
provides the opportunity for added efficiency and elimination of errors in the
manual production of large numbers of ballot displays. However, there is the
danger that centrally-created errors that are not discovered will be propagated
throughout the system.</p>

<p><u>No audit trail of voters' choices</u>: There is, also, a problem with DRE
machines that is not present with ballot-tallying machines. This problem is the
verification that the voter's choices have, in fact, been entered for summation
precisely as the voter desired. The fact that the voter can see his or her
choices on a display, or even receives a printout of the choices made, does not
prove that those were the choices actually recorded in the machine to be
summarized for generating the results of the election.</p>

<p>The assumption of correct recording of voter's choices must be bolstered
with extensive pre-election and post-election review and testing of the logic
of the machine, and further assurance that this logic cannot be fraudulently
altered after the pre- election test. Furthermore, should this logic fail
during the voting process, the logic must have been designed to fail in such a
way that the failure is obvious to the voter. Otherwise, the voter will have no
chance of ensuring that his or her votes are cast on a correctly operating
machine.</p>

<p><u>Difficulty in operability verification</u>: Pre-election and
post-election testing of DRE machines is more difficult than ballot-tallying
machines because, like lever machines, data input to a DRE machine is from a
human. To statistically test the data-entry correctness of a ballot-tallying
machine, a large number of ballots is needed, or a smaller number entered many
times may be used. To statistically test the data-entry correctness of a DRE
machine, either a person or persons have to vote many times, or a device must
be built to simulate the action of a person.</p>

<p>When the voter indicates to the machine (e.g., by pushing a particular
button) that the voting process has been completed, the contents of the
temporary storage unit are added to the more permanent vote summary storage.
Correct operation of the summarization process must be similarly assured.</p>

<p>Some assurance of the machine's correct operation of the summarization
process may be achieved by the retention, in a more permanent form, of the set
of each individual voter's choices that are determined by the machine. These
voter-choice sets have to be retained in randomized locations so that no set of
choices can be traced to a particular voter. If individual voter-choice sets
are retained, they can serve as insurance against the occurrence of certain
difficulties. These difficulties are that the contents of the temporary storage
unit may be incorrectly added into the more permanent vote-summary storage, or
that the vote-summary storage may be accidentally erased before it can be added
to the final totals after the close of polls. The sets of voters' choices on a
particular DRE machine may be summarized on an independent DRE machine or
general-purpose computer for verification.</p>

<p>With DRE machines, no independently created ballots are available for
verification of the correctness of <u>both</u> steps of the vote-tallying
process, identified as steps (3) and (4) in section 3.1: precise recording of
the expression of each voter's choices, and accurate summarization of all
voters' choices to yield final results. Stored voter-choice sets may be used to
verify only the <u>latter</u> of these two steps. The machine-produced
recording of the expression of each voter's choices is not independent of the
machine process that produced it. The machine cannot be used to independently
verify its own correctness.</p>

<p><u>Precinct location</u>: As DRE machines are precinct-located, there must
be the same or greater concern for the vulnerabilities of that situation as
those listed above for precinct-located ballot-tallying machines. These
concerns include the risk of theft, tampering, fraudulent replacement of an
EPROM, accidental interchange of EPROMs, and of defacement or alteration of the
voting surface. Protection of the internal logic of the DRE machine must be of
greater concern than with other types of machines, because of the lack of
independently generated ballots.</p>

<p>3.8 <u>Software For Computerized Vote-Tallying<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Software that is intended for use in more than one election is usually
written in a generalized form, and then is specialized for a specific election.
The generalized software may be provided with a set of tables whose values are
to be filled in during specialization. </p>

<p>This two-step process may be applied to any form of computerized system:
punch card, mark-sense, or DRE. The specialization process establishes the
number and names of offices and issues to be considered by the voters, the
number of candidates and their names for each office, the number of allowable
votes for multiple selection situations, and the implementation of special
voting rules, such as for treatment of straight-party overvotes and for
crossover voting. When the implementation for which the software is being
provided includes precinct-located machines, the specialization process
includes provision of the necessary parameters to complete the tables in the
software of those machines. A device may be provided that can be used to copy
the parameters of the election for each precinct from the main computer into
the EPROM of the appropriate precinct-located machine.</p>

<p>Software written for general-purpose mainframe computers may be written in a
high-level language such as COBOL. Mainframe computers are likely to be
provided with extensive support software, such as compilers and programs for
peripheral interfacing. The availability of such support makes the use of a
language such as COBOL a reasonable decision. (However, see the discussion in
3.8.1 on &quot;hidden code&quot; in connection with general-purpose computers.)
With the advent of single-purpose precinct-located machines having limited
support software, much vote-tallying software now tends to be written in
assembly language. Assembly language may have an additional advantage in
providing the developer with more confidence that the real-time requirements of
on-line ballot processing will be achieved by the object code. However,
assembly language is considerably more difficult to review for logical
correctness.</p>

<p>3.8.1 Vulnerabilities of Software</p>

<p>Vulnerabilities of software include logical errors, the possibility of
&quot;hidden code,&quot; and undocumented changes. No system type, punch card,
mark-sense, or DRE, is immune from these threats. Protection against these
threats requires implementation of effective management procedures that assure
system integrity and security.</p>

<p><u>Logical errors</u>: Several categories of logical errors need to be
separately considered. First, a distinction may be made between generic logical
errors that are independent of the conditions of elections, and
election-related errors. Then, the latter may be subdivided into
rule-implementation errors and setup-condition errors. Rule-implementation
errors concern pre-established voting rules, such as for crossover voting and
for straight-party overvotes. Setup-condition errors involve specific election
matters, such as wrong rotations and incorrect assignments of candidates to
districts.</p>

<p><u>Generic logical errors</u>: These should be identified and eliminated
during qualification testing, in preparation for State certification.
Qualification may be done once, by a national testing laboratory, to satisfy
the requirements of many States. Ideally, qualification should include a test
of all possible features and functions and combinations of them. Resource
constraints may limit testing to only some of the possible combinations of
program features for a system. Qualification testing may involve review of
logical flow charts and specific program code, as well as determination of
system response to the normal flow of ballot data. Additionally, responses may
be evaluated against the input of incorrect data, special cases, large volumes
of data, and unplanned hardware failures while processing. Guidance in planning
computer software acceptance testing is available [32], [33].</p>

<p><u>Rule-implementation errors</u>: Qualification testing requires evaluation
of the software as it will be implemented, so that elimination of
rule-implementation errors should be a byproduct of this activity. A
particularly difficult type of rule to implement is the required restriction in
some States to one vote per candidate per voter in a vote-for-two situation when
a candidate is listed on two party lines for the same office. Should a voter
attempt to vote for the same candidate on both party lines in this situation,
an incorrectly implemented DRE, punch card, or mark-sense system may assign the
candidate two votes. An example of an occurrence of a rule-implementation error
for straight-party overvote is given in section 4.4.2.</p>

<p><u>Setup-condition errors</u>: Elimination of setup-condition errors is
necessary as an activity in pre-election system checkout. In precinct-count
systems, it is important to verify that the computer is implemented for the
same rotation and other setup conditions as seen on the ballot for that
precinct. In central-count systems, testing the system against a large number
of ballots or ballot images may bring to light the presence of setup-condition
errors. In any system in which there is ballot rotation, it is important to
assure that the summarization of each candidate's votes is correct, considering
the different ballot position of the candidate in the various precincts. See
section 3.8.2 for additional automation that could alleviate the problem of
setup-condition error.</p>

<p><u>&quot;Hidden code&quot;</u>: This term refers to a secret computer
program inserted into another program provided to an unaware user. Software that
contains such hidden code is often called &quot;Trojan horse&quot; software.
Hidden code that has a function of copying itself into a user's program and
being transferred elsewhere to repeat its intent is often referred to as a
&quot;computer virus.&quot; The purpose of the hidden code may be malicious, or
it may be used to demonstrate the prowess of the perpetrator, or to
surreptitiously record information for later retrieval. </p>

<p>Assuring the absence of any hidden code within a vote-tallying program is
essential to system integrity; it should be a part of the qualification
process. The task may be assisted with the use of a software engineering tool
that identifies the use of each path in the program during program execution.
If, in the exercise of a vote-tallying program, a particular path is not used
(because the conditions that select it have not been employed), such a path may
be further investigated to determine the selection conditions.</p>

<p>The problem of finding hidden code is complicated when vote-tallying
software is mounted on a general-purpose computer. Hidden code may have been
initially placed in a support program of the computer, for example the compiler
or operating system. Such hidden code may be activated when the support program
is called from the vote-tallying program. If a clock could be accessed by the
hidden code, activation could be arranged to occur at a particular time on a
particular day. The identification of the presence of such hidden code could be
difficult and time-consuming, and a deliberate search, without specific
evidence that the code exists, could be impractical.</p>

<p><u>Assuring system integrity with management controls</u>: Realistic
protection against the presence of hidden code in a general-purpose computer
installation involves the application of management controls over the
installation. An important control for protection against hidden code is the
requirement that software be supplied only from an original manufacturer who is
known, reliable, and can be held accountable. The copying of software from secondary
sources should be forbidden.</p>

<p>Modifications to software must be strictly controlled to prevent
unauthorized changes. Restrictions must be in place to control access to
program codes that have been approved for operation. Authorized changes should
be documented. Previous versions of revised software should be retained
according to established procedures. Due to the threats from &quot;hidden
code,&quot; computer programs have been written that protect against it. The
protective program is intended to run with an application, and to identify any
modifications that are made. However, it is necessary that the application be
initially free of any &quot;hidden code&quot; because only subsequent changes
can be identified. In addition, the protective program might not be able to
prevent unauthorized modification of computed data that is undertaken during
operation from outside the program, for example, from the operating system.</p>

<p>An additional strategy to protect system integrity in vote-tallying is to
have the vote-tallying software provided by its developer with all necessary
support software, including the operating system, as a complete package. No
other software would be necessary. In this way, the complete software for
vote-tallying is separated from the influences of all other software. It is
common practice for software for precinct-located machines to be provided in
this condition. In the future, States may require the complete package of
software (for any type of vote-tallying system) to be deposited with the chief
elections official or an escrow agent, so that the provision of a complete
package of software is responsive to this anticipated request.</p>

<p>The provision of a complete software package enables an additional
protection to be applied: the data authentication code (DAC) [34]. This code
value, a binary number, is computed by first randomly selecting a certain key
value, and then applying that key and a specific mathematical function to the
software package. The key value is kept secret. The computation of the DAC (which
contains the same number of bits as the key) protects the software against both
accidental and intentional, but unauthorized, data modification. To apply the
function, the software package is treated as if it were a digitally-encoded
message, as the DAC was developed to authenticate messages transmitted over
communication lines. In application, the DAC would be generated for the
original software deposited with the State, and would be generated also for the
supposedly identical software used in an election. The two values of the DAC
will be identical if the software packages are identical. (The software to be
used in an election would have to be compared with the master copy before
subsequent specialization for the election.) </p>

<p>There is a very small possibility that other software packages will have the
same DAC value. If the software were altered, the probability of the DAC being
the same for the altered software is extremely small. In fact, the probability
is inversely proportional to the binary power of the number of bits in the DAC.
That is, with an increase of one bit of length in the DAC, the probability of
identicality is halved. Typical lengths of the DAC are from 32 to 64 bits.
Furthermore, altered software could not be designed to have the same DAC value
unless the persons performing the alteration knew the secret key used to create
the DAC.</p>

<p><u>Assuring system security</u>: Provision of all software as a complete
package implies that the computer on which the software is to run can be
dedicated to election operations. With the wide availability and downward cost
trend of minicomputers and microcomputers, this possibility is reasonable, even
for smaller election administrations.</p>

<p>The advantage of a dedicated computer is that access to the computer
installation may be restricted by the election administration. Controlled
access implies restrictions on electronic access to files through terminals or
modems as well as restrictions on personnel entry to controlled areas. Sources
of hardware, software, and supplies that are used may be controlled to assure
accountability, as mentioned above. When the election administration simply
serves as one of many users of a general-purpose installation, such
restrictions enforced by the election administration are not generally available.
The election administration may not be able to assure that the special concern
for security necessary in election operations has the same or higher priority
in the general-purpose installation.</p>

<p>3.8.2 Integration of Administrative Software</p>

<p>It is now possible to integrate vote-tallying software with other software
that relates to the management of elections. Software can be provided that
assists in the establishment of districts and precincts, and in the assignment
of specific residence addresses to specific precincts. To be most effective,
this software would need to be used in conjunction with computerized lists of
all streets, street intersections, and established mailing addresses in the
jurisdiction. The vote-tallying software would not need to be combined with the
election management software, but would require the capability of being able to
receive data from it, for example, through the use of shared storage.</p>

<p>Election management software can be used that helps establish ballot
configurations and ballot rotations, and therefore can be used in connection
with the production of ballots (for &quot;datavote&quot; and mark-sense
systems), ballot pages (for &quot;votomatic&quot; systems), and ballot displays
(for DRE systems). Such automation should assist in the reduction of
setup-condition errors such as rotation errors and candidate mis-assignment
errors. Setup-condition error is a major category of administrative error in
election management. </p>

<p>In metropolitan counties with a ballot rotation requirement as well as with
many overlapping minor jurisdictions, such as incorporated places, school
districts, state legislative districts, and judicial districts, the number of
different ballot styles in a consolidated election may be very large. Los
Angeles county employs about 1800 styles, while other urban counties may use
between 200 and 600. (Consolidated elections, involving Federal, state, and
local offices simultaneously, have been mandated in many places to reduce costs
and improve voter participation.) Computer programs can assist in reducing the
need for multiple entry of the same data, and in sorting out the ballot
requirements of each precinct and district.</p>

<p>3.9 <u>Local Conduct Of Elections And Distribution Of System Types<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>3.9.1 The Number of Major Election Jurisdictions</p>

<p>Each jurisdiction that conducts a major election (an election for Federal or
State officials) must consider the acquisition and use of vote-tallying
equipment. Thus, such a jurisdiction would need to consider the information
provided above in this chapter. The ability of such a jurisdiction to bring
resources to bear on the issues of acquisition and use of vote-tallying
equipment may affect its capability to effectively carry out its
responsibilities.</p>

<p>The discussion below identifies the jurisdictions that carry out major
elections. The data show that there are a large number of small jurisdictions
with election administration responsibilities. Application of resources
available at the State level may be necessary to provide smaller jurisdictions
with the capability to adequate deal with all of the issues of computerized
vote-tallying.</p>

<p>In the United States, the responsibility for administration of elections is
a State function (although the Federal Government may impose requirements, and
has done so). Our only officials elected nationwide, the President and
Vice-President, are indirectly elected by the selection of &quot;electors&quot;
in each State. In each State, local governments actually conduct the elections
for State and Federal offices, as well as for offices within their own
jurisdictions. In 41 of the States, these major elections are carried out at
the county level. (In four of these States, certain &quot;independent&quot;
cities serve as county-equivalents and similarly carry out these elections.) </p>

<p>In nine States, major elections are carried out in units of government
called minor civil divisions (MCDs) by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. An MCD is
a first-order division of a county, and only States in the Northeast and
Midwest have such units. An MCD may be a municipality (e.g., a city), or it may
be another type of jurisdiction. The nine States in which MCDs conduct major
elections are Michigan and Minnesota, in which the non-municipal unit is called
a township, and the six New England States and Wisconsin, in which the unit is
generally called a town (although other names, such as &quot;plantation,&quot;
&quot;location,&quot; and &quot;gore&quot; identify a few units in Maine, New
Hampshire, and Vermont).</p>

<p>Conduct of the election at the local level implies that, at that level,
voter registration files are maintained, vote-tallying equipment is procured
and maintained, voting locations are determined, precincts are staffed, votes
are counted, and election results for the jurisdiction are produced. In
November of each even-numbered year, when there are many Federal, state, and
local officials elected, there are a very large number of mini-elections being
administered simultaneously. Thus, the report that there were &quot;Challenges
in 4 States&quot; [6] to a vote-counting program should be interpreted to mean
that there were challenges to particular contests in elections in four local
jurisdictions, one in each of the identified States.</p>

<p>There are about 3140 county-level units in the United States, including some
44 independent cities serving as county-equivalents. However, only about 2870
of them conduct elections for State and Federal offices in the 41 states in
which counties and county-equivalents perform this function. There are about
7610 MCDs conducting elections in the nine states identified above. In addition,
Washington (coextensive with the District of Columbia) and about 19 other
cities (including New York and Chicago), not included above as
county-equivalents or MCDs, conduct their own elections. Thus, there are some
10,500 local governments conducting major elections nationwide. Some of them
are very large in population, e.g., Los Angeles County, and New York City, and
some are quite small, e.g., Loving County, Texas, 1980 population 91. These
10,500 local governmental units essentially define the potential for use of
vote-tallying equipment for major elections.</p>

<p>3.9.2 Distribution of System Types</p>

<p>The distribution of system types (for precinct use only, excluding use for
absentee ballots) has been determined through a nationwide survey taken by
Election Data Services, Inc. of Washington, DC [35]. The survey, based on data
acquired in the first quarter of 1988, shows the following distribution,
according to 1986 registration figures:</p>

<p>With some 45 percent of voters still not using computerized equipment (still
using either paper ballots or lever machines), considerable opportunity for the
implementation of new types of systems continues to exist. For example, it may
be expected that in the near future registered voters' use of DRE machines will
increase a percent or two, primarily as a result of the replacement of lever
machines.</p>

<p>3.10 <u>Future Vote-Tallying Systems<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>3.10.1 Technological Possibilities</p>

<p>With the increasing availability of data transmission over networks of
computers and terminals, there is a possibility of on-line voting through the
use of such networks. Even at present, precinct-located devices could be
connected to central computers in an on-line mode. Whether this has some benefit
greater than its costs is arguable, as results cannot be released before the
polls close. Certainly, communications security must be a consideration.</p>

<p>Large single-application networks already in use that are user-oriented are
networks for lotteries and for remote banking. Voting requires significantly
more choices than a lottery or remote banking. In a lottery, the bettor selects
just one or two numbers. In banking, the accountholder typically makes a binary
choice of either withdrawal or deposit, selects an account type, and specifies
a single amount. In voting, there may be Federal, State, and local offices on
the ballot, plus several questions. The total number of contests requiring a
voting decision may be twenty or more, and several contests may permit a
selection of more than one candidate from a longer list of nominees.</p>

<p>In use of a network for voting, the traffic conditions would be extreme. The
network would be used only about twice a year, but when in use, the volume of
traffic would be very high. In a presidential election, over one-half the
adults in the nation would be expected to use the network for about four
minutes each over a twelve-hour period. In Los Angeles County, over 200,000
voting uses per hour in a presidential election would be required. Whether this
could be both technically and economically feasible is problematic.</p>

<p>A possibility that may be more economical is the use of an existing network
to which voting use is added when necessary, provided that the capability for
the volume of use is present. The general telephone network might be utilized
through voice response (to advise the voter of the choices) and push-button
phones (for the voter to make choices), but again, volume is a strongly
limiting factor. Cable television is another possibility, if it can be
generally implemented in an interactive mode.</p>

<p>An important requirement in voting is the verification of registration. In
remote-terminal banking, verification of accountholder status is typically
accomplished at this time with a magnetic stripe credit-type card and a
personal number. At point-of-sale terminals, it is common for sales personnel
to obtain account status and to debit accounts to an on-line system with the
aid of data on the magnetic stripe. (Lotteries have no personal identification
requirement for use.) Whether it would be feasible to have such a system, like
the one in use for remote banking, for a small number of uses per year by a
very large number of persons is also problematic. Conceivably, social security
number, driver's license number, or some other permanently assigned number
could be used as an identifier. A card for voting might have other uses at
public facilities, such as for library withdrawals or parking in public
garages.</p>

<p>The process of remote personal identification is the subject of research. In
the future, if a system with video bandwidth were available (e.g., interactive
cable television), remote signature verification could be possible. At present,
a precinct official can compare a prospective voter's signature with a
computer-stored copy, but computer comparison without human intervention is not
yet considered to be sufficiently accurate. With less bandwidth (e.g., the
telephone network), voiceprint verification could be employed, but only if that
process could be shown to be highly accurate. Again, this application is not
considered to be technically feasible, in a general sense, in the immediate
future. It is possible that a personally assigned &quot;smart card,&quot; a
credit-type card with an embedded computer chip, could be used interactively at
a computer terminal to aid the process of remote identification.</p>

<p>3.10.2 Political and Social Priorities</p>

<p>The implementation of any system must be in accord with political and social
priorities, as well as meet technical criteria of accuracy and reliability. For
example, any installed system must meet several basic requirements: equal
access by individuals to the voting franchise, verification of registration,
the ability to cast a vote in secret without intimidation, and assurance of
fairness to opposing parties. The advantage of establishing polling places (as
opposed to voting from homes through cable television, for example) is that
neutral locations where voting can occur without intimidation are set up. At neutral
and public locations, representatives of opposing parties can be present and
can watch the administration of the voting process. The establishment of
technological access to the voting process that is available to some persons
but not to others (because of acquisition costs borne by individuals) may not
be consistent with the concept of equal access.</p>

<p><b>4. <u>SOME RECENT DIFFICULTIES IN COMPUTERIZED VOTE-TALLYING<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p>The following are examples of difficulties that have occurred in the use of
computerized vote-tallying, in the years 1980-1986. The purpose of providing
these narratives is to demonstrate the types of difficulties that have been
recently experienced. These reports provide support for recommendations
concerning procedures that can be followed so that other election
administrators may avoid similar difficulties. It is not the purpose of these
reports to assess or assign responsibility or culpability for the difficulties
experienced.</p>

<p>The examples were chosen for several reasons. Four of the situations
(Carroll County, Maryland; Charleston, West Virginia; Elkhart County, Indiana;
and Palm Beach County, Florida) had been identified in an article in the <u>New
York Times</u> [6]. The situation in Dallas had been reported there in a separate
article [36]. The remaining situations provide elucidation of particular types
of problems and, in addition, reliable information about the situations was
made available by authoritative or competent sources.</p>

<p>As in the 1975 vote-tallying report [1],in which examples of reported
difficulties were given, the descriptions should be read with the following
caution:</p>

<p>It is not intended that these descriptions be the definitive versions of
what occurred. No absolute proof can be offered that the events occurred
exactly as described. However, reported data have been supplied by named
sources on the scene, and exact quotations by participants and observers are
given when appropriate.</p>

<p>4.1 <u>Carroll County, Maryland: November, 1984<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Carroll is a county of about 100,000 population whose county seat,
Westminster, is located about 30 miles northwest of the city of Baltimore. On
November 8, two days after the Tuesday, November 6, 1984 general election, and
in accordance with the rules of the Maryland State Administrative Board of
Election Laws (SABEL), voted punch card ballots from two districts of Carroll
County were taken to a neighboring county, Frederick, to be rerun on an
independently-managed system. (Similarly, ballots from Frederick County were
taken to Westminster to be rerun.) This rerun, in order to verify the original
results, is necessary under Maryland regulations before the results may be
certified. </p>

<p>It was clear from these reruns that one of the computers used was in error
in determining the outcome of a contest between Wayne Cogswell and incumbent T.
Edward Lippy, for Carroll County School Board. Manual counts of the votes on
ballots from both Frederick and Carroll Counties showed that the Carroll County
computer was the one that was incorrect. The initial but unofficial count, made
public on the evening of the election, had incorrectly indicated that Cogswell
was the winner.</p>

<p>An investigation, undertaken the next day (November 9) by Craig Jester, a
county computer program contractor, demonstrated that a wrong utility computer
program for reading the ballot cards had been used. After the correct utility
program was installed, the results coincided with those obtained manually and
with the Frederick County computer. The utility program, named COLBIN, had been
previously written by Jester under contract to the county and had been
successfully used in the May, 1984, primary election.</p>

<p>The purpose of the COLBIN utility program was to read the voted ballot cards
in the &quot;column binary&quot; format used for voting, rather than in a
simpler format. At the request of Carroll County data processing personnel and
to reduce the price, Computer Election Systems, the vendor of the vote-tallying
system, had supplied the system with an elementary utility program that could
read cards only in the simpler format. With the simpler format, ballot cards
would be required to have a maximum of one punch per column, not an acceptable
situation for the Carroll County ballot. Carroll County contracted locally
(with Pelorus, whose president was Craig Jester) for the COLBIN utility
program.</p>

<p>On Saturday, November 10, the count was rerun (using the vote-tallying
system including the COLBIN program). Members of the county Board of Elections
and the County attorney were in attendance. The count indicated that Lippy was
the winner. On Wednesday, November 14, eight days after the election, the Board
of Elections certified the results, naming Lippy.</p>

<p>The cause of the error was reported in the <u>Carroll Sun</u> on Nov. 18,
1984 in an article by Steve Kelly [37]. A more complete explanation was
provided in a letter, dated Nov. 26, 1984, from Thomas J. Van de Bussche,
Administrator of the Data Processing Center of Carroll County, to Dr. Thomas
Lewis, President of the Carroll County Election Board [38]. Mr. Van de Bussche's
letter was included in a report submitted by Dr. Lewis on December 5, 1984 to
Mrs. Marie Garber, Administrator of SABEL [39].</p>

<p>Mr. Van de Bussche admitted that, in testing an improved vote-tallying
system provided by Computer Election Systems, he had inadvertently replaced the
production version with a test version that did not include the COLBIN utility
program. The logic and accuracy test of the vote-tallying system on Oct. 25,
1984, performed prior to the election in accordance with Maryland regulations,
produced results consistent with the test ballots used. None of the test
ballots had more than one punch in any column. Therefore, the test ballots did
not reveal the error.</p>

<p>In the general election of November 6, 1984, the contest for the school board
seat in question was listed in the same punch card columns as a home rule
issue. The two contests were listed on different ballot pages of the
&quot;votomatic&quot; ballot holder. The combination of votes for a school
board candidate and a particular home rule position in the same column created
a punch configuration that was not recognized as valid by the elementary
utility program. As a result, some valid votes were not recorded in both the
school board and home rule issue contests. Most of the votes not recorded
(about 13,000) were for Lippy, because many Lippy voters chose the home rule
position listed in the same card column. Votes not recorded on the home rule
issue did not affect the ultimate outcome for that question. If the COLBIN
utility program had been used, all votes on the contests would have been
recognized as valid.</p>

<p>In summary, the incorrect announcement of the result of the school board
contest on election night was due to mistakes by the Data Processing Center of
Carroll County in using the wrong utility program and in using a perfunctory
logic test that did not disclose the problem before the election. No factual
evidence is available that contradicts the documentation submitted to Mrs.
Garber by Dr. Lewis and Mr. Van de Bussche.</p>

<p>The incorrect announcement was not due to any error in the vote-tallying
computer system supplied by the primary vendor, Computer Election Systems, nor
any activity undertaken by its representatives. Nevertheless, on July 29, 1985,
the <u>New York Times</u>, in referring to this particular situation, reported
that &quot;The vote counting program that has been challenged in .... Maryland
was developed by Computer Election Systems of Berkeley, Calif.&quot; [6]</p>

<p>The error was discovered after the election but before certification because
of a Maryland regulation that required recounting on an independently managed
system. This specific regulation was based on a recommendation that
&quot;further confidence in the machine-counted results can be achieved if
mandatory machine recounting of a percentage of the precincts for each race is
carried out on a different, independently managed computing system than that
used to produce the official count.&quot; [40]</p>

<p>On June 11, 1985, another recount of the school board race in question was
carried out, using the Carroll County computer, again including the COLBIN
program. This recount was undertaken at the request of the State court in which
Mr. Cogswell, the defeated candidate, had filed a suit asking that the results
of the election be re-examined. The recount verified the correctness of the
election results certified on Nov. 14, 1984, although Mr. Van de Bussche has
indicated that the recount results did not exactly match the count reported in
the certification.</p>

<p>Mr. Van de Bussche has stated that the recount, carried out with all sides
in attendance, was hurried and less than precise in that, with the permission
of the court, card reader &quot;checks&quot; were ignored in the ballot-reading
process. Usually, a card reader &quot;check,&quot; indicative of a reading failure,
would result in a decision to re-read the entire precinct of voted ballot
cards. Instead, the card or cards causing the &quot;check&quot; remained unread
and the reading process continued. The failure to re-read an entire precinct
upon occurrence of a read &quot;check&quot; resulted in a small but random
reduction of votes to both candidates, according to Mr. Van de Bussche. The
differences were not significant enough to raise reasonable doubt as to the
correctness of the certified results.</p>

<p>According to a July 11, 1985 story by Chris Guy in the <u>Carroll County
Times</u> referring to the court-ordered recount, &quot;...defeated candidate
Wayne Cogswell had verification that use of an incorrect computer program
caused a nearly 13,000-vote mistake in the unofficial totals released election
night.&quot; [41]</p>

<p>4.2 <u>Charleston, West Virginia: November, 1980<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The following discussion was developed primarily from newspaper articles in
the <u>Charleston Daily Mail</u> and <u>Charleston Gazette</u>.</p>

<p>Following the general election of November, 1980, three defeated candidates
charged gross violations of election laws in Kanawha County, the county in
which Charleston is located. Defeated U.S. Representative John Hutchinson first
filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice alleging that his civil
rights had been violated. The other defeated candidates who joined Hutchinson
in charging election law violations were former State Delegate Leonard
Underwood and former Kanawha County Commissioner William Reese. Underwood, who
was the first to initiate a suit, had filed for a recount after he was edged
out in the election by Delegate John M. Wells. (Underwood was re-elected as a
State Delegate in 1982.)</p>

<p>According to an article on June 2, 1981 in the <u>Charleston Gazette</u>
[42], Darlene Kay Dotson, an employee in the office of the County Clerk, had
stated in a deposition taken for Underwood's suit that the ballots from the
election in question had been run through the computer on the day after the
election to get &quot;precinct-by-precinct reports.&quot; According to law, the
ballots are to be secured for the official canvass, which was not done at that
time. Two members of the County Commission, Robert Silverstein and Al Shepard,
each possessed the only key to separate padlocks that were both needed to open
the vault in which the ballots were kept, and both denied opening the vault or
giving the keys to anyone else to do so.</p>

<p>According to the June 2, 1981 article, Carolyn Critchfield, also an employee
of the office of the County Clerk, told Shepard that, to her knowledge, the
ballots hadn't been out of the vault before the canvass. &quot;Shepard said
Mrs. Critchfield believed Ms. Dotson had events confused with the primary
election when the ballots were run the day after the election,&quot; the
article reported.</p>

<p>There was also concern about a test run of the computer's tabulation
ability. Ms. Dotson had testified, according to the newspaper article, that
neither County Clerk Margeret Miller, nor the county commissioners would sign
the certification approving the test, and that she had to sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. Underwood had filed for a recount on December 2, 1980, and then, on
December 16, he asked the circuit court to require that the election ballots be
manually counted to compare them with the computer tabulation. In early
February, 1981, a circuit judge denied Underwood's request, but on February 17,
1981, he filed an appeal with the state Supreme Court, asking for the manual
count or a retabulation by the computer. However, following the circuit judge's
denial of Underwood's request, the ballots had been destroyed by order of the
County Clerk.</p>

<p>The state law in effect at that time stated that ballots shall be preserved
for 60 days and &quot;if there be no contest pending as to such election and
their further preservation be not required by any order of a court, they shall
be destroyed.&quot; According to Ray Dodson, lawyer for the County Commission,
Mrs. Miller told him that she did not know that Mr. Underwood had filed an
appeal in the state Supreme Court. Dodson said that there is some question as
to whether Underwood's appeal constituted a true contest under the law.</p>

<p>On February 24, 1982, according to a February 25, 1982 article in the <u>Charleston
Daily Mail</u> [43], County Clerk Margaret Miller was indicted by a special
Kanawha County grand jury on six felony and nine misdemeanor charges. Three of
the felony charges had to do with the removal of ballots from packages after
the unofficial election night vote tally and before the County Commission's
vote canvass that produces official totals. Two felony counts accused Mrs.
Miller with allowing a vault containing the ballots to be opened between
election night and the canvass. The other felony charge stated that she allowed
the ballots from the general election to be destroyed while Underwood's suit
was pending. In June, 1983, Mrs. Miller was found innocent of all charges. The
jury had concluded that there was no &quot;willful misconduct.&quot; [44]</p>

<p>However, in February, 1983, the three unsuccessful 1980 candidates filed a
civil suit in Federal district court against Mrs. Miller and 15 other
individuals. According to a newspaper article on February 5, 1983 [45], the
suit alleged that the three were prevented from being elected because of a
conspiracy on the part of the individuals named as defendants. In addition to
Mrs. Miller, defendants included Mrs. Miller's husband Steven; former U.S.
Representative Mick Staton, who defeated Hutchinson in 1980; Kanawha County
Commissioners Henry Shores and Robert Silverstein; Kanawha County Prosecutor
(and later mayor of Charleston) James Roark; several employees of the County
Clerk's office including Darlene Dotson and Carolyn Critchfield; John Cavacini,
Jr., a campaign worker in 1980 for Governor Jay Rockefeller; Computer Election
Services, supplier of the electronic voting equipment used in 1980 in Kanawha
County; several employees of that company; and Bernard H. Meadows, deputy clerk
of the Boone County Commission.</p>

<p>Previous to the filing of the suit, former U.S. Representative John
Hutchinson had been reported as charging that one of the defendants, John
Cavacini, Jr. was in possession of final returns for the 1980 election two days
after the Nov. 4, 1980 election and more than 30 days before the official
canvass was completed on December 8, 1980. Hutchinson said, according to a June
5, 1982 article [46], that information in his possession</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;...proves without any question, the machines
didn't count at the canvass. I think the results were predetermined. It's
conclusive in as much as the documentation shows after numerous absentee and
challenged ballots were counted that the totals didn't change. The machine did
not count the ballots.&quot;</p>

<p>Hutchinson also added that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;There is a very great probability that the
numbers were in the machine and the machine never counted anything.&quot; </p>

<p>In December, 1983, Hutchinson, Underwood, and Reese filed an amended lawsuit
that specifically alleged that Kanawha County Clerk Margaret Miller and her
staff rigged the vote-counting computers to predetermine the results, that
ballots were mishandled, that some ballots were not opened until the canvass
and then were counted to meet a predetermined result, that all ballots were not
counted, that the vote canvass was falsified, and that the computing equipment
was not properly tested prior to the election. The three plaintiffs also
claimed that Boone County election officials tampered with the computer
equipment before the election, that ballots were altered, and that an accurate
ballot tally was not made. Irregularities in procuring the vote-counting
equipment in both Kanawha and Boone Counties were also alleged [47].</p>

<p>In May, 1985, the suit was dismissed (charges against several defendants had
been previously dropped), and the <u>Charleston Daily Mail</u> editorialized on
May 3, 1985 as follows:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;[U.S. District Judge Charles] Haden sat
through days of non-evidence on behalf of three plaintiffs -- former
Congressman John Hutchinson, House of Delegates member Leonard Underwood and
former county commission candidate William Reese -- all of whom lost election
races in 1980 and have been mad about it now for more than four years.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;The plaintiffs were somehow allowed to bring
this petty case to trial. Throughout, they failed to present a particle of
proof to support their claims that 11 defendants conspired to deprive them of
public office.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;People who run for election obviously like
to win, but they must be prepared to lose. And barring solid evidence of fraud,
they ought to accept their losses graciously without proceeding to harass
either the individuals who ran against them or those who counted the
votes.&quot; [48]</p>

<p>Appeals of the dismissal were similarly dismissed, and the U.S. Supreme
Court announced on February 24, 1987 its refusal to hear the case.</p>

<p>Possibly influenced by Underwood's initial suit requesting a manual recount
of the ballots, West Virginia amended its law on electronic voting systems in
1982. The revised subsection 3-4A-28 (4) is as follows:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>During the canvass and any requested recount, at
least five percent of the precincts shall be chosen at random and the ballot
cards cast therein counted manually. The same random selection shall also be
counted by the automatic tabulating equipment. If the variance between the
random manual count and the automatic tabulating equipment count of the same
random ballots is equal to or greater than one percent, then a manual recount
of all ballot cards shall be required. In the course of any recount, if a
candidate for an office shall so demand, or if the board of canvassers shall so
elect to recount the votes cast for an office, the votes cast for that office
in any precinct shall be recounted by manual count.</p>

<p>4.3 <u>Dallas, Texas: April, 1985<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>In the election for Mayor of Dallas, held April 6, 1985, the incumbent
Starke Taylor avoided a runoff by obtaining slightly more than the required 50%
of the vote. There were three opponents to Taylor: Morehead, Goldblatt, and
Daniel. Max Goldblatt, the leading opponent, requested a recount. A machine
recount (including absentee ballots that were mixed in) was undertaken on April
11, 1985, by order of the District Court. The original results and the recount
results are summarized below: [49]</p>

<p>The machine recount showed that, overall, Taylor's votes decreased by 25,
while Goldblatt's votes increased by just one, an insufficient change to cause
a runoff election. Mr. Goldblatt did not raise a challenge to the accuracy of
the recount at that time, and Mr. Taylor was confirmed as Mayor for the
two-year term.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the recount results would appear to confirm the vote
totals produced in the original count, but a precinct-by-precinct review [50]
raises technical questions about the accuracy of the combined human and
computer system that produced them. There were 250 precincts in this election,
but only 89 precincts showed no change in votes for any of the four candidates
in the contest for mayor. Taylor's votes changed in 100 of the 250 precincts,
while Goldblatt's votes changed in 113 precincts.</p>

<p>In the recount, Taylor lost one vote in 45 precincts, two votes in each of
ten precincts, three votes in each of four precincts, and five votes in each of
two precincts. Taylor gained one vote in 25 precincts, two votes in each of
nine precincts, three votes in each of three precincts, and five votes in each
of two precincts. These changes sum to a loss of 25 votes.</p>

<p>Goldblatt lost one vote in 47 precincts, two votes in each of five
precincts, three votes in each of two precincts, four votes in each of two
precincts, and five votes in each of two precincts. Goldblatt gained one vote
in 41 precincts, two votes in each of ten precincts, three votes in each of
three precincts, and twelve votes in one precinct. These changes result in an
overall gain of one vote.</p>

<p>In addition, the number of ballots counted changed in 109 of the 250
precincts, for a total loss of 27 ballots [51]. Fewer ballots were tallied in
59 precincts, while more ballots were tallied in 50 precincts. In precincts
that lost ballots, one fewer was counted in 37 precincts, two fewer in each of
eleven precincts, three fewer in each of seven precincts, four fewer in each of
two precincts, five fewer in one precinct, and seven fewer in one precinct. In
precincts that gained ballots counted, one more was counted in 33 precincts, two
more in each of 13 precincts, three more in each of two precincts, and four
more in each of two precincts.</p>

<p>For the recount, data on changes in precinct vote totals for the candidates
were made available to the public. However, the number of ballots counted in
the recount in each precinct was not included in the data released. The changes
in ballots counted that are presented above are based on data collected by Ms.
Terry Elkins, campaign manager for Max Goldblatt. Ms. Elkins was present at the
recount, and copied down the number of ballots tallied for each precinct.</p>

<p>The causes of the changes in ballots and votes counted are not clear.
However, changes occurred in such a manner as to yield both positive and
negative values in approximately equal amounts, and the number of precincts in
which changes occurred tended to decrease as the value of the change became
more severe. This situation suggests a problem of system inaccuracy, rather
than of deliberate bias. This inaccuracy could be of either human or mechanical
origin, or both. </p>

<p>When numbers of votes change in a system using pre-scored punch cards, the
problem is often ascribed to hanging chad, although failure of the card readers
to read the cards accurately is a reasonable possibility. If the problem is said
to be due to chad, the explanation is that a hanging chad may fall out,
creating either a vote or an overvote; or, a hanging chad may be pressed back
into place, usually eliminating a vote. </p>

<p>The cause of changes in ballots counted is more perplexing. In the system
used in Dallas, ballots were hand-fed into the card readers one at a time, by
both the voters and the recounters. Consequently, it is unlikely that, on
several occasions, two cards were fed at one time and counted as one. However,
the system used at the precincts by voters required each voter to handle his or
her ballot twice. First, the voter fed the ballot into the precinct ballot
computer. Assuming that the computer accepted the ballot, the voter was then
supposed to retrieve the ballot from the output of the computer and drop it
into a ballot box. In some cases, a voter may have put the ballot into the
ballot box without first having fed the ballot through the computer, or
conversely, the voter may have fed the ballot through the computer more than
once. On the other hand, inaccurate card counting by the machines, due to card
jams, is a possibility. Only a thorough audit of voter sign-in lists, compared
with an accurate count of numbers of ballot cards delivered from the precincts
to the election headquarters could provide a more confident basis for a
statement of the cause of the identified ballot count discrepancies.</p>

<p>In September, 1986, Ms. Elkins concerns about the election were publicized.
These concerns included matters other than the differences between the original
count and the recount, as discussed above. Instead, a major aspect of the
information provided by Ms. Elkins at that time concerned the total number of
ballots cast for Mayor. She noted that the &quot;Combined Canvass Report&quot;
produced by the Dallas County Election Department on the evening of April 6
stated on page 14 that there were 78,398 ballots cast, while the same document
stated on page 27 that there were 80,208 ballots cast. Furthermore, the
&quot;Official Cumulative Report&quot; (which serves as an overvote-undervote
report), produced by the Election Administration on April 8, stated that there
were 79,783 ballots cast. Ms. Elkins contended that documentation that she had
gathered supported none of these numbers of total ballots cast.</p>

<p>Ms. Elkins also noted another apparent discrepancy in the results reported
for a City Council seat. In that situation (District 7), the number of votes
tallied was reported to be 10,365. This value exceeded the number of ballots
reported to be cast, 9,679. In addition, in one precinct, the initial number of
ballots cast, 263, was replaced later with another value, 515. These technical
concerns of Ms. Elkins were supplemented by concerns that the results presented
on the computer printouts were created independently of the actual totals of
the voted ballots through a deliberate attempt to subvert the outcome. [52]</p>

<p>As a result of Ms. Elkins' complaints, it was reported that Attorney General
Jim Mattox and Secretary of State Myra McDaniel began investigations into
voting discrepancies. According to the <u>Dallas Morning News</u> of Sept. 23,
1986, &quot;the probe centers on allegations that computerized voting equipment
and computer programs used to tabulate state and local elections may have been
tampered with to bring about `preprogrammed' results.&quot; [53]</p>

<p>In that same newspaper article, Ms. Elkins was quoted as saying that
&quot;the allegation is that the computer used to count the votes was given new
instructions after it calculated that Max Goldblatt was leading Starke Taylor
by 400 votes.&quot; Ms. Elkins has noted that the Dallas County computer had
encountered difficulties shortly after 8 p.m. on election night, and that the
candidate who was leading at 8 p.m., prior to the computer difficulties, was
not leading when the computer reported again.</p>

<p>Ms. Conny McCormack, Dallas County Elections Administrator, admitted that
the documentation for the April 6, 1985 election could appear contradictory.
Her explanation was that the difficulty concerned the treatment of &quot;split
precincts,&quot; that is, those precincts bisected by the Dallas city boundary.
There were 11 such split precincts. The value of 78,398 for ballots cast was
produced by assuming zero ballots cast from these split precincts. The value of
80,208 for ballots cast was produced by adding the total ballots from the split
precincts, including ballots cast outside of the city. The final value of
79,783 for ballots cast included only those ballots cast within the city of
Dallas. Ms. McCormack contended that the recount generally confirmed the
correctness of the originally reported outcome. [54]</p>

<p>Ms. McCormack's explanation of the problem of reporting split precincts was
supported by the vendor of the vote-tallying system. In a memorandum on the
subject, a vendor representative stated that there was a difference between the
type of reports requested by Dallas County Elections Department for the PBCs
(precinct ballot counters) and for the central computer. The central computer
was used to accumulate totals reported by the PBCs. The coding for the central
computer included provision for split precinct specification of ballots cast,
but the coding for the PBCs did not allow for this. According to the vendor,
&quot;this extra statistical option was not requested by Dallas for that
election.&quot; [55]</p>

<p>The vendor representative further stated, in the same memo, that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;Since the [data] packs did not have this
[split precinct] information to transmit, all of the precincts which were
transmitted had a &quot;zero ballots cast&quot; for the districts. Again, total
ballots cast and all candidate votes were present and correct.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;On the cumulative report, then, the votes
received by the district candidates were much greater than the ballots cast
figures for those districts. Although the explanation for this apparent anomaly
is now clear, it clearly was a suspicious looking situation.&quot;</p>

<p>With regard to the change in ballot totals reported for one precinct, Ms.
McCormack stated that this was due to a failure of a PBC data pack. This occurs
about 2% to 4% of the time, she stated. The procedure when this happens is as
follows:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;When [a failure of a PBC data pack] occurs,
the actual ballot cards are counted at the central counting station. Such
discrepancies from PBC tape to actual ballots cast is determined by examination
of the specific Ballot and Seal Certificates. When there is a discrepancy
between number of persons signing the signature roster at the precinct and the
number of ballots cast according to the PBC tape, then the ballots from that
precinct are counted centrally.&quot; [54]</p>

<p>A summary of the ballots cast in this election, as officially reported, is
shown below, by district. It can be seen from the table that the largest
component of ballots from split precincts occurs in District 7, where the
increase from Column A to Column B is 1,661. However, 422 of these ballots were
from outside the city, so that the total number of ballots cast in District 7
inside the city is 10,918. The latter number is shown in Column C, and it is
appropriately higher than the total votes for candidates in District 7, which
was 10,365. [56]</p>

<p>Certain technical problems raised by Ms. Elkins seem to have been given a
credible explanation, on the basis of information made publicly available in
late 1986. However, as Warner Croft stated in his testimony to the Texas House
of Representatives Committee on Elections:</p>

<p>&quot;There is an audit trail but there are holes in it. The audit trail
should consist of everything from the ballots themselves to the console log
being printed by the computer on election night. The present laws don't
identify what the minimum requirements are, so that, with the absence of a
minimum definition, it just does not exist. You go after these things, and the
laws don't require that they be kept on file now, so they have been destroyed
months ago. So you really couldn't tell if there was fact to these allegations
are not. That has been one of our problems. Records aren't available; there are
no auditable results.&quot; [22]</p>

<p>Ms. Elkins' charges that the results were &quot;preprogrammed&quot;
independently of the actual votes cast were not put to rest in 1986. In March,
1987, the Texas Attorney-General's office asked the District Attorney of Dallas
County to assist in reviewing the election complaints. The review concerned
&quot;the reliability of Dallas County's computerized election system and
whether the equipment is vulnerable to fraud through subtle changes in computer
programs.&quot; [57]</p>

<p>On October 14, 1987, the office of the District Attorney of Dallas County
replied to the Texas Attorney General's Office with a letter [58] including the
following: </p>

<p>&quot;We have carefully considered each of the thirteen (13)
&quot;discrepancies&quot; discussed in the report [submitted by your office],
and ... each of the &quot;discrepancies&quot; has been explained to our
satisfaction; and although we verified that a few coding errors were in fact
made, we have concluded that they were the result of unintentional &quot;human
error.&quot; We find no evidence whatsoever to indicate any deliberate fraud in
the 1985 election, nor do we find any credible evidence to indicate an attempt
to manipulate the election or its outcome by anyone, be it candidate, election
official, or vendor.&quot;</p>

<p>Some knowledgeable persons have found this statement puzzling, in view of
Warner Croft's testimony that necessary documents constituting the audit trail
had been previously destroyed. </p>

<p>In the April, 1987, mayoralty election, split precincts were eliminated by
the Dallas County Election Administration. Precincts that had been bisected by
the Dallas city boundary or City Council district boundary were divided into
two or more separate precincts. Letters A and B, added to the precinct
identifier, were used to distinguish the formerly combined precincts, as in
1193A and 1193B. </p>

<p>4.4 <u>Elkhart County, Indiana: November, 1982 And November, 1986<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>4.4.1 November, 1982 General Election </p>

<p>Elkhart is a county of about 140,000 population on the northern border of
Indiana, located about 90 miles east of Chicago. In lawsuits filed in state and
Federal courts, several losing candidates alleged that election fraud occurred
in the administration of the general election of November 2, 1982.</p>

<p>In this election, the computer facilities of a bank located in the county
seat of Goshen were used for ballot-counting purposes. The office of the county
clerk had limited computer expertise for carrying out its responsibilities for
management of the ballot- counting process. Technical operations related to
computer processing of the ballots were undertaken by bank employees and by an
employee of the vendor of the vote-counting software. The bank's computer was
capable of multiprogramming, and bank operations continued during ballot
counting. </p>

<p>It is important to note at this point that punch card ballots in a general
election in Indiana have &quot;straight party&quot; punch locations. A voter
who votes one (and only one) of these punch locations automatically votes for
all candidates of that party unless the voter specifically votes for a
candidate of another party in a particular contest. A vote in a particular
contest always overrides the straight party vote. This feature of Indiana
ballots figures prominently in this situation.</p>

<p>Procedural and computer-related errors in the election affected at least
three contests. The errors concerned votes for the Town Board of Wakarusa (a
town within Elkhart County), votes for Districts 2 and 3 of the County Council,
and votes for a State Representative contest.</p>

<p>The boundaries of the town of Wakarusa are wholly within Olive Township of
Elkhart County. Some of the voters in this township live within Wakarusa, and
some live outside the town. Only those residing within Wakarusa are entitled to
vote for the Town Board. However, no arrangements were made to distinguish town
residents from non-residents for purposes of casting ballots. All voters in the
township were given the same ballot. The result of not separating ballots of
residents and non-residents was that Town Board candidates received more votes
than they were entitled to obtain. The extra votes were from voters residing
outside the town, and these consisted primarily of straight party votes that
were assigned by the vote-tallying computer program to Town Board candidates as
well as to other candidates on the ballot. In addition, there may have been
votes for individual Town Board candidates by non-resident voters who
mistakenly voted for them. </p>

<p>The Wakarusa problem was not discovered until several days after the results
were certified, when an election worker realized that the total number of votes
for Town Board candidates was much higher than that number of votes which could
have been cast by voters entitled to vote for Town Board. The problem was
&quot;solved&quot; by an informal agreement approved by the Election Board
under which all straight party votes were eliminated for Town Board candidates.
This &quot;solution&quot; disenfranchised those voters within the town who
lawfully cast straight party votes. The change overturned one outcome, but the
loser was dissuaded from suing. According to Elkhart attorney David T. Stutsman,
the agreement to change the outcome was in violation of Indiana law, and a
legally correct solution would have been to hold a new Town Board election.</p>

<p>In the counting of votes for County Council, votes for candidates in
Districts 2 and 3 were interchanged. This situation became apparent to one of
the Election Board members when Higgins, the unopposed candidate in District 3,
was initially shown to have a significant number of opposing votes. In
addition, Barnes, the incumbent in District 2, was getting almost no votes,
while Wiedenhoeft, Barnes' novice opponent, was winning a large majority. This
unexpected condition was pointed out, and the interchange was discovered. The
error was corrected by changes in control cards that were carried out by an
employee of the software vendor. This latter individual had been sent from
another state by the software vendor for the sole purpose of assisting in
ballot-counting operations. He appeared for the first time on the afternoon of
the election, and returned to his home state immediately following the
completion of the computerized vote-tallying.</p>

<p>In the contest for State Representative, it become apparent late in the
evening of November 2 that an incorrect punch position was being used to tally
votes for one of the candidates, Philip T. Warner, in his race against Mike
Puro. The software vendor's employee again changed some control cards, and a
retabulation was undertaken. The retabulation resulted in a significant change
in vote totals: an increase of 3,710 for Warner and a decrease of 53 votes for
Puro. The reason that there was a decrease in Puro's totals was because of
individual votes for Warner by voters who had also indicated a straight party
punch for Puro's party. Before Warner's votes were properly tabulated, the
straight party punches had added to Puro's total, but the specific votes for
Warner on the same ballots negated these straight party votes.</p>

<p>It seems clear, from the Wakarusa situation, that the full implications of
computer processing of ballots were not completely appreciated by the persons
responsible for running the election: the Election Board and its employees. In
addition, it seems clear, also, from the tabulating errors in the County
Council and State Representative contests, that insufficient attention was paid
by those responsible for running the election to examination of the &quot;edit
list&quot; that identifies, for the computer, the assignment of punch locations
to candidates. Adequate testing of the computer system prior to use appeared to
be lacking, possibly to an extent inconsistent with Indiana law.</p>

<p>The alleged misfeasances have been described in lawsuit briefs filed by the
losing candidates, and documentation on the charges has been obtained from
David T. Stutsman, their attorney. A major source of problems in the election
was the apparent failure to properly test the equipment prior to use. The
losing candidates charged that no test of the automatic tabulating equipment
was undertaken five days prior to the election, as required by the Indiana
statute then in effect, and that only a superficial test was done at about 4
p.m. on election day. </p>

<p>According to Mr. Stutsman, this test on election day consisted of a count of
just 13 test ballots each for only two precincts of the 63 precincts involved
in the election. As a result of a lawsuit concerning this election, an alleged
configuration of these 13 cards and the results that they generated on the
computer have now come to light. According to this information, the test
ballots should have generated three lawful votes for the Democratic senate
candidate, but instead they generated four such votes. One test ballot that
should not have produced a vote contained a straight Democratic punch, and
individual punches for both Democratic and Republican senate candidates. A second
test ballot that should not have produced a vote contained straight party
punches for both the Democratic and Republican parties, that is, an uncountable
straight party overvote. One of these test ballots probably supplied the
incorrect fourth test vote. If this information about the test ballots and
results is correct, the ballot counting process on November 2, 1982 should not
have proceeded until the logical error was corrected. As stated in the Indiana
statute I.C. 3-2-4-4(f) in force at the time:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;If any error is detected [in the test], the
cause therefor shall be ascertained and corrected and an errorless count shall
be made before the automatic tabulating equipment is approved.&quot;</p>

<p>Other errors in administration that have been alleged were that the changes
in the control cards that were made were not accompanied by system tests, that
the computer systems's clock was disabled (thereby preventing times of console
actions from being reported), and that no precinct numbers were printed on the
ballot cards.</p>

<p>Computer consultants hired by the losing candidates submitted statements
including the following:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;The Edit List was not correct when the
program was initiated.... Thorough tests would have caught these
irregularities.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;Given the nature of the undocumented program
correction ... it is impossible to know exactly how the program tallied the
votes. The control log shows no test of accuracy after the [vendor's]
representative modified the parameter cards.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;The lack of a clear audit trail and the lack
of error reports, the convoluted code reports plagued with errors, and the
unquestioned trust in an untested electronic process seems to be a major
problem with this system comprised of hardware, software, and users.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;In the opinion of [the computer consultants,]
it would be possible to modify program logic with the use of inserted control
cards. It would be possible to change accumulated vote totals by reading in
control cards at the appropriate time during the program execution. This would
be unknown to the election officials or anyone but an experienced operator.
This program uses alter verbs which allows program logic changes with the use
of control cards inserted at execution time.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;A knowledgeable operator can change the
program logic in execution with insertion of control cards ... many
possibilities for change in program logic and vote tally exists.&quot; [59]</p>

<p>The losing candidates' case, brought before the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Indiana, named the local board officials as defendants. It
was alleged in the pleadings in that case that the computer system was not
tested, that there was no error-free test of the system before the official
count, that there was no actual count of the ballots and that the alleged count
and certification of the vote count was fraudulent. The pleadings and briefs
further stated that the control cards for the operation of the program were
altered by the vendor representative during the counting, and that the acts by
the election officials were willful, wanton, reckless and oppressive. </p>

<p>However, the court entered a summary judgment on Feb. 21, 1985 against the
losing candidates because, in the court's opinion, there were no allegations of
any &quot;willful conduct which undermines the organic processes by which
candidates are elected&quot; (language of an important precedent, <u>Hennings
v. Grafton</u>) [60]. The judgment of the lower court was affirmed by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which stated that &quot;the
appellants (i.e., the losing candidates) confuse fraud with what is at most
willful neglect.&quot; [61] Mr. Stutsman notes that the plaintiffs were not
allowed to present their evidence in the case. The lawsuit was dismissed as a
matter of law, without a trial on the merits. Therefore, a jury was not allowed
to hear the case.</p>

<p>A second Federal lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Indiana,
continues to be pending, with the vendor named by the <u>New York Times</u> as
the principal defendant. This suit charges negligence, breach of contract, and
strict liability, alleging that the computer system used in the election was
sold in a defective condition and caused loss and damage to the losing
candidates. In addition, it is alleged that the vote counting was a fraud and
that the certification of the vote totals was false and fraudulent.</p>

<p>4.4.2 November, 1986 General Election</p>

<p>Following the 1986 general election, a State-mandated recount was undertaken
that included ballots from Elkhart County. In this recount, directed by Dean
David Link of the Notre Dame Law School, it was discovered that the computer
program used to count ballots in Elkhart County was not counting correctly
according to Indiana law. The problem occurred in the treatment of ballots that
were overvoted in the &quot;straight party&quot; positions. According to
Indiana law, these ballots should be voided for all partisan contests. Instead,
the ballots had been counted in the contest being recounted. These ballots were
eliminated in the recount.</p>

<p>4.5 <u>Gwinnett County, Georgia: November, 1986<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>A recount undertaken in a State Senate race showed the loser in the first
count winning the contest by 77 votes. The original tally had given challenger
Steve Pate a winning margin of eight votes. However, the recount gave incumbent
Donn Peevy 13,682 to Pate's 13,605. According to an article in the <u>Atlanta
Constitution</u>, November 13, 1986, &quot;the recount was the result of a
computer hardware error ... affecting hundreds of uncounted votes ...&quot;
[62] The &quot;computer hardware error&quot; in question was believed to be a
problem with the card readers that read the pre-scored punch card ballots.</p>

<p>Allegations raised in this election included charges of &quot;hidden
ballots.&quot; It appears that a box of ballots and documents received from one
precinct was initially believed to consist of the complete set of voted ballots
on top of other documents in the box. When the documents were removed from the
box after the ballots on top had been counted, more ballots were found under
the documents. In addition, it was &quot;charged that ballots from two
precincts did not arrive at the elections office until early on the morning of
Nov. 5 [the day after the election] in the car of the elections board
member,&quot; according to the article in the <u>Constitution</u>.</p>

<p>The original count was undertaken on a system consisting of two personal
computers, each with a card reader, networked together to drive one printer.
For the recount, it was agreed to separate the two computers and to count the
ballots twice, once on each computer. Unfortunately, the recounts obtained from
the two computers were slightly different, although not of a difference
sufficiently large to overturn any contest.</p>

<p>The Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) was asked by the office of the
Secretary of State of Georgia to render any possible assistance. GTRI decided
to review the situation and to determine the source the discrepancies between
the two computer outputs. The investigatory team, headed by Dr. Britain
Williams, hoped to separate the causes of the errors into at least two classes:
those caused by handling of the ballots by voters and voting officials, and
those caused by the hardware. According to Williams, &quot;everything that
could have been done to insure the accuracy of the recount was, in fact, done
and the discrepancies observed are inherent in this type of system. A thorough
analysis of these results will be conducted in an attempt to estimate the
inherent error in using pre-scored ballots.&quot; [63]</p>

<p>A report has now been produced by Williams and an associate. [106] The
report compares differences in the results in three counts: the general
election, and the recounts on the two individual machines. The report states
that: </p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;Errors were either tabs which were not yet
dislocated from their pre-punched positions in the ballot, or stray tabs which
filled other previously punched-out positions (+ and - errors).&quot;</p>

<p>According to the report, errors were caused by such factors as handling
procedures, the ballot puncher (which was of the &quot;votomatic&quot; type),
the vote counter, the punched card's density, vote position on the ballot card,
human error, and pure chance. The report concludes that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;...there should be a system set up to make
the voters and especially the volunteer workers aware of the effects procedural
care has on the accuracy of tabulations (since this was where the main problem
was discovered). Details like not putting large (or any) rubber-bands around
the ballots would also be advisable (especially since custom ballot carriers
are provided).&quot;</p>

<p>4.6 <u>Illinois - Statewide Testing Program<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The Illinois State Board of Elections, Division of Voting Systems, under the
direction of Michael L. Harty, (now Director of Elections, Maricopa County,
Arizona) has undertaken tests of vote-counting computer systems. Between 1983
and 1987, the division conducted 48 tests of the automatic tabulating equipment
and computer programs in 41 election jurisdictions. The tests have involved
anywhere from 1,000 to 65,000 test ballots. The division found apparent
computer program tabulation errors in 11 of the election jurisdictions tested.
The division reports that most of these errors would not have been discovered
without adequate testing. As a result of its testing experiences, the Division
of Voting Systems has concluded in its <u>Summary of Findings and Observations
on State Board of Elections Computer Testing Program</u>, revised February,
1987: [64]</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;The testing of computer vote tabulation
systems needs to be improved substantially. At a minimum, voting systems tests
must be large; must test all voting positions; must test overvotes and
undervotes; column binary punches; straight and split party votes; nonvoting
position punches; and must test for every candidate in every ballot
configuration in every precinct. Only by extensive testing of a computer vote
tabulation system can we be <u>reasonably</u> assured that tabulation of the
ballots will be entirely accurate&quot;.</p>

<p>The following descriptions of programming, program initialization, and
hardware problems in local jurisdictions in Illinois are taken from the
reference given above.</p>

<p>4.6.1 Programming and/or Program Initialization Errors</p>

<p><u>Whiteside County - 1986 General Primary Election</u>: The system
tabulated votes on ballots that contained invalid security codes (ballot style
identifiers).</p>

<p><u>Morgan County - 1985 Consolidated Election</u>: No straight party votes
registered for the candidates of a party. However, this did not affect the
individual candidate totals. </p>

<p><u>Peoria County - 1985 Consolidated Election</u>: The computer program
misassigned straight party punches for a candidate for township supervisor. The
candidate received a tally from a straight party punch for the opposite party
but failed to receive a tally from the straight party punch of his own party.</p>

<p><u>Sangamon County - 1985 Consolidated Election</u>: The computer program
would not accept ballots with proper ballot style identifiers. This error was
not discovered by the test previously run by the local jurisdiction. In
addition, ballots in precincts with more than one ballot style did not contain
different style identifiers. Thus, it would not have been possible to separate
the voted ballots of the different styles.</p>

<p><u>Logan County - 1985 Consolidated Primary Election</u>: Tabulation errors
occurred when precincts were split by ward boundaries. When the same punch
position was assigned to different candidates in different wards in the same precinct,
votes for one of the candidates were not tallied by the computer program.</p>

<p><u>Effingham County - 1984 General Election</u>: A county-level office was
not being tabulated in five precincts, though votes were assigned to the
office.</p>

<p><u>Jackson County - 1984 General Election</u>: A translation error between
precinct returns and the summary report caused the summary report to fail to
properly reflect the precinct sum totals for certain candidates.</p>

<p><u>LaSalle County - 1984 General Election</u>: The straight party vote was not
being tabulated for all candidates in a party. In addition, when an overvote
occurred in the straight party column and also in an individual candidate's
punches on the same ballot, the candidates involved actually lost a vote, i.e.,
had their vote totals reduced by a vote (instead of simply being denied a
vote).</p>

<p><u>Grundy County - 1984 General Primary Election</u>: Forty-seven percent of
the precincts had one or more of the following types of errors: (1) the
assignment of the wrong county board districts in the precincts, (2) the
deletion of candidates in precincts, (3) the incorrect assignment of candidates
to precincts, (4) assignment of only 2 vote for each vote cast, and (5)
incorrect totals of precinct votes on the summary report for several
candidates.</p>

<p><u>Rock Island County - 1984 General Primary Election</u>: Two votes for
each vote cast were being tabulated for a candidate. In addition, the
&quot;no&quot; votes on a proposition were not being counted. Further, the
summary report totals did not properly reflect precinct sum totals for several
candidates.</p>

<p>4.6.2 Hardware and Punch Card Difficulties</p>

<p><u>City of Chicago - 1987 Consolidated General Election</u>: The system test
indicated an approximate 3% failure rate of program chips. The chips were
improperly programmed or &quot;burned.&quot; The malfunction would have been
identified during the public test.</p>

<p><u>Boone County - 1987 Consolidated Primary Election</u>: Due to substantial
ballot quality defects, a system test could not be executed. New test ballots
were ordered.</p>

<p><u>Pulaski County - 1986 General Primary Election</u>: The principal disk
that contained the vote-tallying program failed to operate for the system test.
The duplicate (backup) disk was employed. The principal disk operated correctly
for the public test. No reason for the problem was discovered.</p>

<p><u>Jackson County - 1984 General Election</u>: Column binary punching
appeared to cause severe tabulation delay. In addition, the card reader stopped
occasionally during the tabulation of a precinct. When this condition occurred,
the results already obtained had to be erased and all the ballots for the
precinct had to be retabulated. The cause of this difficulty could not be
immediately ascertained.</p>

<p><u>Will County - 1984 General Election</u>: During the system test, the card
reader was jammed twice by ballots. The ballots involved were almost completely
destroyed in the process.</p>

<p>4.7 <u>Maricopa County, Arizona: September, 1986<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>A clerical error that would have interchanged votes for the two major
parties in this primary election was caught during testing. Pre-punches (ballot
style identifiers) were incorrectly specified, and if the errors had not been
caught, votes in the primary contests in each party would have been assigned to
the other party during tallying. Poor communication between the county data
processing department and the election administration contributed to the
problem. A well-designed testing process caught the error, so that ballot
counting during the actual election was not affected. [65]</p>

<p>4.8 <u>Moline, Illinois: 1985 Consolidated Municipal and Township Election<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The following report is primarily based on an article in <u>Illinois Issues</u>,
November, 1985, that was republished in a newsletter of the National Center for
Policy Alternatives. [66] </p>

<p>In this election on April 2, 1985, the failure of a card reader to read
correctly caused a losing aldermanic candidate for Moline City Council to be
put into office. The error was not rectified until about three months later.</p>

<p>The failure of the card reader was not initially apparent. It was only
discovered after defeated Moline 3rd Ward aldermanic candidate Earl Wendt went
to court to demand a recount. Wendt had lost by two votes, and the recount was
ordered by Rock Island County Circuit Court. In the recount on May 14, Wendt
picked up two votes, but his opponent Allen McCauley picked up 92 votes. The
large change in McCauley's total demonstrated that a serious error in
vote-tallying had occurred. The data showed that the error was in the failure
of the system to tabulate many straight party votes for McCauley. Further investigation
appeared to demonstrate that the problem was a slipping timing belt in one card
reader.</p>

<p>As a result of the Wendt-McCauley recount, the party of losing 4th Ward
aldermanic candidate Charles Reynolds also demanded a recount in a petition to
the Moline City Council. Reynolds was of the same party as McCauley. However,
the City Council denied this petition and two similar petitions from other
candidates on the basis that the 30 days following the election allowed for
such petitions had expired.</p>

<p>Following these denials, Dennis Faust, assistant State's Attorney submitted
a petition of <u>quo warranto</u> to Chief Judge David DeDoncker of the 14th
Judicial Circuit. The <u>quo warranto</u> petition, whose origin in
Anglo-American law goes back to Edward I in 1275, is used to remove &quot;any
person [who] shall usurp, intrude into, or unlawfully hold or execute any
office...&quot;, according to the Illinois Revised Statutes. Faust's theory was
that if members of the Moline City Council hadn't received a majority of the votes,
then they held office illegally. </p>

<p>On July 8, Judge DeDoncker agreed to a recount for the office of city clerk
and for three aldermanic offices including that for the 4th Ward, despite the
fact that the 30-day period had expired. He stated that there was no knowledge
that a machine was not working until 40 or 50 days after the election. &quot;We
had legal American voters who voted and did not get their votes counted&quot;,
DeDoncker said. The judge appointed representatives of the vendor of the
vote-counting system to serve as officers of the court and ordered them to
conduct a recount. A judge of a higher court refused to stay the recount, and
it proceeded. </p>

<p>As a result of this recount, alderman Roy Lear picked up two votes, but his
opponent Charles Reynolds added 135, making the final count 557 for Reynolds to
473 for Lear. Through a court order, Lear was removed from the city council.
Reynolds was seated in his place. Lear did not appeal.</p>

<p>4.9 <u>Oklahoma County, Oklahoma: November, 1986<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>In the general election of November, 1986, difficulties perceived by an
independent group of local observers involved, among other items, the
operability of the precinct-located, mark-sense computers, and the anomalous
numbers of counted ballots that were reported. These observers, David Clampitt,
Carolyn Burkes, and Sue Milton, submitted the data on which the discussion
below is based.</p>

<p>The county signed a contract to purchase the mark-sense vote-counting
equipment in the summer of 1984. The State of Oklahoma has no system of prior
State approval of voting devices before such devices may be purchased by a
county. However, no county may purchase a type of voting device before the
State Board of Elections has implemented rules of operation for that type of
device. Four counties in the State utilize mark-sense type voting devices.
Oklahoma County is the only county of these four utilizing the particular model
in question. </p>

<p>Engineering tests on the particular devices purchased by Oklahoma County
were not carried out by the county until November and December, 1984, when the
equipment was being delivered. A feature of the equipment noted in the tests
was that a certain number of ballots were not being processed (were being
treated as unreadable) by the machines. Approximately 1.5% of the ballots were
so treated by each of the two different units being tested. According to the
report, &quot;non-processed [ballot] cards were not visibly different from
those accepted and tabulated, nor were they always the same cards on successive
runs.&quot; [67]</p>

<p>The vote-counting equipment was used in a special election at about the time
of the test, and the report notes that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;The frequency of non-processed ballots
[5.22%] was observed in several precincts to be significantly higher than that
observed during testing. This is attributed to improper insertion of the card
by the voter, namely, failure to insert the card vertically and release it
cleanly....We attribute this rate primarily to voter unfamiliarity with the
system....&quot;</p>

<p>The report recommended that:</p>

<p>&quot;Although the [vendor's equipment] is judged to comply with all
applicable statutes and regulations,....as [one of four] desirable product
improvements, the vendor should be encouraged to reduce the frequency of random
non-processing of acceptable ballots.&quot;</p>

<p>During the November 4, 1986 general election, the number of non-processed
ballots was over 2% in a significant number of precincts. According to State
rules, the county Board of Elections &quot;has the authority&quot; [68] (but is
not required) to recount precincts with over 2% non-processed ballots. The
county board has used its discretion in selecting particular precincts for
reprocessing. Reprocessing, if done at all, is done on the county's central
computer. Not all precincts with over 2% non-processed ballots were reprocessed
in the November, 1986 general election. </p>

<p>Ballots that are not reprocessed and read by the central computer would
never be counted at all, except under a court-ordered manual recount. There are
no State or county rules which would permit non-processed ballots to be counted
manually in order to have the manual results added to those results already
obtained by machine.</p>

<p>Results of the 1986 general election in Oklahoma County show, in many cases,
a lack of reconciliation of the number of voters signed in at each precinct
with the number of ballots cast. <u>Table 1</u> below demonstrates that fact. </p>

<p>In this election, each voter was given three ballot cards, designated as A,
B, and C. The number of processed A, B, and C ballot cards and the number of NP
(non-processed) ballot cards are totalled in <u>Table 1</u> for selected
precincts. The total of the ballots tabulated (<u>Total</u> column) may be
compared with three times the number of voters signed in at each precinct (<u>Voters
Times 3</u> column), as shown in the table. Values in these two columns in the
table for the same precinct differ in most cases. According to a January 25,
1987 article in <u>The Sunday Oklahoman</u> entitled &quot;Security of
Elections Described,&quot; [69] &quot;an examination of the ballot accounting
forms used in last November's election in Oklahoma County revealed that a
number of them are neither filled out nor signed.&quot; In addition, said the
article, precinct voting materials are not logged in on a time sheet when
received at the central location, except for the first and last precincts.</p>

<p>The &quot;%NP&quot; column in <u>Table 1</u> indicates the percentage of
non-processed ballots, over all ballots counted. The &quot;R&quot; column
indicates whether, as a result of the non-processed ballots, the precinct was
recounted on the county's central computer. Several precincts with significant
percentages of non-processed ballots were not recounted, at the discretion of
the County Election Board.</p>

<p>In most of the precincts identified in <u>Table 1</u> that were recounted,
the total number of ballots counted exceeds the three times the number of
voters. From this situation, it may be inferred that the recounting of
non-processed ballots (sometimes up to four times in an effort to get them to
be read) was not properly accounted, and repetitive attempts at reading added
incorrectly to the total number of ballots. The failure to match totals of
ballots fed into the machines against voters signed in calls into question the
reported individual candidate totals, as no proper cross-foot total can be
obtained.</p>

<p>The failure of proper accounting naturally raises the issue of a manual
recount. Although there was no request for a manual recount in this election,
there have been such requests in other elections in Oklahoma County. It has
been the position of the Oklahoma County Election Board that State law, until
recently, did not allow manual recounting, since the Board's interpretation of
State law is that the same system that was used for the original count must be
used for recounting. However, this interpretation has been continually
challenged in the courts and has been overturned. There have been manual
recounts in Oklahoma County, over the protestations of the Election Board. In
the most recent session of the State legislature, a law was passed allowing a
recount petitioner to select either a manual recount or a machine recount, in
those counties that use vote-tallying devices. </p>

<p>In addition, during the November 4, 1986, general election, over one-third
of the 273 voting machines used in the election failed in some manner, some
more than once. The most prevalent type of failure was that the machine simply
stopped accepting ballots. [70]</p>

<p>Another anomaly of the reported results of this election in Oklahoma County
is that the lower-level offices and obscure State questions on the ballot
appeared to be as popular with voters as the office of governor. That is, the
traditional &quot;fall off&quot; of voter interest in the lower-level offices
and State questions did not occur, at least according to the reported results.</p>

<p>This condition is shown in <u>Table 2</u> below. The votes for the offices
of governor, State representative, and on State question #589 are given. The
office of governor appeared on ballot card A with other State-wide and Federal
offices. The State question appeared on ballot card B, and the office of State
representative appeared on ballot card C.</p>

<p>In every case in which a vote was reported in the identified precincts, the
office of State representative received more votes than the office of governor.
In some cases, State question #589, an unimportant issue that would have been
expected to receive little public interest, received more votes than the office
of governor. Most independent election observers would have difficulty
accepting this situation unless a very special condition of strong public
concern could be demonstrated.</p>

<p>A commentary on this situation with regard to precinct #270, the last
precinct listed in <u>Table 2</u>, was reported by <u>The Sunday Oklahoman</u>
on January 25, 1987 in an article entitled &quot;Uncertain Vote Count Puzzling
to Analysts.&quot; [71] The article pointed out that in demographically
comparable Precinct #459 in Tulsa County, the unusual reversal of drop-off did
not occur. The race for governor in the comparable Tulsa County precinct
received more votes than other races, as would be expected.</p>

<p>4.10 <u>Palm Beach County, Florida: November, 1984<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Following the November, 1984, general election, David Anderson, defeated
candidate for Property Appraiser of Palm Beach County, sued to contest the
election of his opponent Rebecca Walker. [72] Anderson asked that the Court
order a hand recount of the ballots, or a hand recount of at least several
precincts in that election. The issues on which Anderson sued included handling
of the ballots, precinct procedures for signing in voters, ballot secrecy,
counting of punch card ballots, and possible manipulation of the computer
program. Anderson's initial complaint was dismissed in Palm Beach County
Circuit Court on March 1, 1985 [73], but he filed an amended complaint. With
regard to the computer-related points at issue, Anderson charged in his amended
suit that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;There were irregular counts from the
computer on each total, each time it was run. The tabs caused by perforations
punched in the voting process in the computer cards did not all tear loose,
thereby seriously affecting the vote results. It is apparent that because of
the type of equipment and method used, that it is impossible to accurately
count any election.&quot; [74]</p>

<p>Clearly, there were problems of hanging chad (&quot;tabs..[that] did not all
tear loose&quot;) in this election. In a document filed in connection with this
suit (Defendant Walker's First Request for Admission to Plaintiff) [75], the
results of a computer recount of another contest in the same election were
given. In the other contest, Owens versus Perry, Owens' original total of
137,994 increased by 279 votes in the recount, while Perry's original total of
137,817 increased by 214 votes. According to Ms. Jackie Winchester, Supervisor
of Elections in Palm Beach County, these changes were due to chad that were not
fully removed in the first count (thereby resulting in no vote) but which fell
out before the recount (thereby adding to the original totals). However, no
report of undervotes or overvotes is required by the State of Florida or by
Palm Beach County, and therefore it is not possible to confidently deduce from
the data that this reasonable supposition is correct.</p>

<p>In his amended complaint, Anderson also charged that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;The election was run on machines that permit
a means of changing the result on the ballots contrary to the votes cast by
electors through an alter system in the commands in the computer program, or
through the use of a single or several ballot cards specially marked with an
alter code on them, which the Plaintiff has reason to believe was activated
during the counting of the ballots.&quot; [76]</p>

<p>No documentary evidence in support of this claim was filed by Anderson, and
in fact, in his initial suit that was dismissed, Anderson had alleged that the
election &quot;may have been&quot; run on machines that should not qualify
under state laws since &quot;there may be&quot; under the system a means of
changing the result through an alter system in the commands in the computer
program.</p>

<p>In a motion to dismiss, defendant Rebecca Walker noted that the Department
of State of the State of Florida previously approved the voting system in use,
and that there is no provision in the Florida election laws allowing for a <u>hand</u>
recount of ballots cast through the use of an electronic voting system. [77]
The Owens-Perry contest had been recounted by computer two days after the
initial count because it was sufficiently close to meet the statutory recount
test. The Anderson-Walker contest was insufficiently close to require a
recount, but was actually recounted as a by-product of the Owens-Perry recount.
The computer recount of the Anderson-Walker contest was unofficial, and the
same result showing Walker winning certainly did not satisfy Anderson.</p>

<p>On March 28, 1985, according to Ms. Winchester, a hand count of ten
precincts selected by Mr. Anderson was undertaken by the staff of the
Supervisor of Elections. Mr. Anderson and his observers were in attendance.
&quot;Mr. Anderson and everyone else present agreed that were no substantive
differences&quot;, reported Ms. Winchester. On September 10, 1985, Mr.
Anderson's amended suit was &quot;dismissed with prejudice&quot; by Circuit
Court Judge Richard I. Wennet. [78]</p>

<p>4.11 <u>Salt Lake County, Utah: November, 1980<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>A last minute breakdown of one of Salt Lake County's two ballot reading
computers caused a delay in production of the tally. No county totals were
produced for two hours, and the final tally was produced at 5:39 a.m. the
following morning. The situation was reported in an article in the <u>Salt Lake
Tribune</u> on Nov. 6, 1980. [79]</p>

<p>Although spare parts were available, a decision was made during the count
not to attempt to repair the machine, but to keep going with the one ballot
computer that was working. </p>

<p>The situation might have been helped if a head start on ballot counting had
been implemented, as was done with paper ballots. However, it was believed that
this might have created confusion in the meshing of early-collected ballots
with the later ones for the same precincts. In addition, no election workers
were available to collect the early ballots. It would have cost extra money to
hire additional workers, as others were occupied with regular jobs during the
day.</p>

<p>It was noted that the complete 100% tally was available much earlier than
such a tally would have been available if paper ballots had been used.</p>

<p>4.12 <u>Stark County, Ohio: May, 1986<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The following description is adapted from the account given in the July 21,
1986 issue of <u>Election Administration Reports</u> [80], Richard G. Smolka,
Editor, with permission of the publisher.</p>

<p>Stark is a county of about 400,000 population whose county seat, Canton, is
located about 60 miles south-southeast of Cleveland. An unprecedented
court-ordered &quot;audit&quot; (hand recount) of a Stark County computer
recount in a county commissioners primary contest again named as winner the
candidate who had apparently won in the official results of the May 6, 1986
primary but lost in the computer recount. The &quot;audit&quot; revealed a computer
program error that permitted over 100 invalid punchcard ballots to be counted
in the recount.</p>

<p>At the end of the election-night count, Robert A. Capestrain held a 26-vote
lead in the three-person contest to be Democratic nominee for county
commissioner. A recount by computer on May 27 (held because of the closeness of
the original tally) put Patty Miller ahead by 5 votes. For the computer
recount, the computer program used to obtain the original results was not used.
Instead, a special computer program was written, in order to count only the
disputed contest and not the other contests on the ballot. The mystery,
however, was why 165 additional votes had been tallied in the recount although
the number of ballots read by the computer was the same.</p>

<p>The following table provides the votes for the three candidates in the
computer tally of the primary, the computer recount, and the hand counted
&quot;audit&quot;:</p>

<p>The 165 additional votes in the recount were randomly distributed throughout
the 481 precincts. Most precincts had no changes, and most of those with
changes had a one-vote increase. All candidates gained votes. The names of the
candidates were rotated by precinct in the ballot booklets in positions
98-100-102, and the extra votes were distributed among these numbers on the
ballot cards. Each of the three positions received approximately the same
number of additional votes.</p>

<p>Initially, there seemed to be no satisfactory explanation for the additional
votes. Hanging chad was suspected as a possible cause. Fraud was much less
likely because it would have required access to ballots from all affected
precincts, working knowledge of the ballot rotations, plus sufficient time to
locate and punch ballots which had not been voted for county commissioner.</p>

<p>Following the computer recount that indicated a reversal of the initial
count, candidate Capestrain filed suit challenging the recount. Because of the
unusual nature of the recount result and rumors of fraud, the candidates,
attorneys, election board, and court agreed to &quot;audit&quot; procedures
that would resolve any identifiable problems with &quot;hanging chad&quot; as
well as ensure that the vote count would be complete and accurate. Most importantly,
they all agreed that the audit would constitute a final resolution of the vote
count dispute. Judge Harold E. DeHoff of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas
included a provision in the agreement that all parties would waive any rights
of appeal.</p>

<p>The audit included a manual count and a computer count. Forty two-person
teams were assigned to manually count the ballots under specific rules. The
court order also provided guidelines on removal of hanging chad and specified
that only the two master commissioners, appointed by the court, could remove a
suspected chad or hanging chad.</p>

<p>Before the start of the audit, Ohio Director of Elections Dorothy Woldorf
and area manager Robert Braun of the vote-counting system vendor gave the
counting teams both written and verbal instructions on procedures to be
followed. The manual recount began at 9:00 a.m. and continued until completion
at about 7:45 p.m.</p>

<p>After the first several precincts were manually counted, it became evident
that the audit was producing totals more closely matching the original count
rather than the recount. By 11:00 a.m., the recount program error had been
uncovered. The error was due to the failure of the recount program to
distinguish between Democratic, Republican, and unaffiliated ballots.</p>

<p>In the May 8 primary, voters were given Democratic, Republican, or
unaffiliated ballots, depending on their party registration. The logic in the
computer program and associated header cards that were used to tally the
primary ballots was able to distinguish among the different types of ballots,
even though all the ballots were tallied on the same computer equipment.</p>

<p>In the recount, all the ballots were again tallied together on the same
equipment, but the logic of the recount program could not distinguish among the
different ballot types. It was apparently believed by the author of the recount
program that the assignment of unique ballot positions to each contest and
candidate was sufficient to separate the ballots. However, some Republican and
unaffiliated voters had &quot;voted&quot; (i.e., punched out chad) in a ballot
position assigned to a candidate in the Democratic county commissioner contest.
These ballots were not counted in the Democratic primary tally, but they were
counted by mistake in the computer recount.</p>

<p>In the audit on July 8, the ballots were first separated by party before
being given to the two-person teams. The separation was easily accomplished
because the ballot types were distinguishable by color. Consequently, in the
manual recount, &quot;votes&quot; by Republican and unaffiliated voters were
not tallied.</p>

<p>During the audit, the master commissioners completed removal of chad on 28
ballot cards. Nine of these were identified as &quot;hanging chad&quot;, and
the others were termed &quot;bulging chad&quot;. One commissioner said that it
was obvious that the voter had detached the chad, but that it had been pressed
back into position, probably when the cards were stacked. The removal of the
chad by the commissioners had no effect on the outcome, but did increase the
vote by a net of 26 over the original count.</p>

<p>4.13 <u>Summary Of Problem Types<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The problems in specific elections that have been described are categorized
below in order to identify the most prevalent types and elucidate the specific
difficulties.</p>

<p>4.13.1 Insufficient Pre-election Testing</p>

<p>Lack of sufficient pre-election testing appears to be a major source of
operational difficulty. Problems in the following situations would have been
avoided if significantly increased numbers of test ballots, using many
different expected vote combinations, had been run through the machines and the
results compared with expected answers:</p>

<p>* Carroll County, MD; Nov., 1984: A larger number of test ballots, using
different combinations of voting possibilities, would have demonstrated the
incorrect vote-counting due to the presence of the wrong utility program, and
would have avoided the embarrassment and controversy that resulted.</p>

<p>* Elkhart County, IN; Nov., 1982: A larger number of test ballots should
have brought to light the three separate coding errors: failure to distinguish
Wakarusa voters from other voters in the same township, the reversed tallying
in the County Council races, and the incorrect punch position used to tally
votes in the State Representative contest. The fact that all three errors were
identified after a significant number of votes had been actually tallied (and
because the strange results raised suspicions) supports the concept that more
test ballots would have brought the errors to light before the tallying began.</p>

<p>* Elkhart County, IN; Nov., 1986: A larger number of test ballots, testing
the correctness of the logical rules, would have identified the incorrect logic
of the straight party overvote implementation.</p>

<p>* Illinois Statewide Testing Program: The use of a larger number of test
ballots would have made clear the logical errors in programming and coding that
were identified. This need was recognized by the testers from the State Board.
[64]</p>

<p>* Moline, Il; April, 1985: The implementation of pre-election testing might
have brought to light the ballot-reader failure before the election, and
therefore might have prevented the losing candidate from being certified as the
winner.</p>

<p>* Stark County, OH; May, 1986: A more complete checkout using a large number
of ballots would have identified the logical error that caused the program used
in the recount to fail to distinguish between voters of different political
parties.</p>

<p>* A situation <u>not</u> appearing in this category is Maricopa County, AZ.
Adequate checkout procedures in that jurisdiction prevented the incorrect punch
position assignment from being implemented in the election.</p>

<p>4.13.2 Failure to Implement An Adequate Audit Trail</p>

<p>* Dallas, TX; April, 1985: The failure to separately report numbers of
ballots cast in each part of a split precinct produced ambiguous and suspect
results.</p>

<p>* Elkhart County, IN; Nov., 1982: Changes in control cards, to compensate
for errors that were discovered, were not documented; retest of the system,
following the changes, was not done.</p>

<p>* Oklahoma County, OK; Nov., 1986: There were, in many precincts,
significant differences between number of ballots tallied and number of voters
reported as voting. In some cases the number of ballots tallied exceeded the
number of reported voters. These differences made the results appear suspect.</p>

<p>4.13.3 Failure to Provide for a Partial Manual Recount</p>

<p>* Charleston, WV; Nov., 1980: The charges of conspiracy, and the expensive
and time-consuming lawsuits, might have been avoided if the local laws had
required, or allowed for, a partial manual recount without a court order. When
the ballots were destroyed, the essential evidence to disprove an incorrect
tally, of whatever cause, was made permanently unavailable.</p>

<p>* Dallas, TX; April, 1985: Although a recount was undertaken, it was a
machine recount, using machines managed by the same organization. No manual
recount, or recount managed by an independent organization, was done.
Consequently, some suspicion remains.</p>

<p>* Moline, IL; April, 1985: A partial manual recount would have brought to
light the incorrect results due to the ballot-reader failure, and would have
prevented the losing candidate from being certified as the winner.</p>

<p>* Oklahoma County, OK; Nov., 1986: The unusual results in which lower-level
contests received more votes than the contests on the top of the ballot could
not be validated. Thus, a serious loss of public confidence could not be
prevented.</p>

<p>* Palm Beach County, FL; Nov., 1984: The inability, under Florida law, for
the defeated candidate to force a recount (because his race was insufficiently close),
raised suspicions unnecessarily. A partial hand recount, as is done in
California, might have prevented this situation from arising.</p>

<p>* A situation <u>not</u> appearing in this category, because an unofficial
manual recount was taken in order to verify the different results obtained on
an independently-managed system, is Carroll County, MD, November, 1984. The
combined manual count and recount on an independently-managed system revealed
the error in the original count.</p>

<p>4.13.4 Inadequate Ballots or Ballot Reader Operation</p>

<p>* Carroll County, MD; November, 1984: A recount, in which read
&quot;checks&quot; were ignored, showed slightly different tallies than the
certified results. Chad is also believed to be responsible for some of the
difference. </p>

<p>* Dallas, TX; April, 1985: The recount taken a few days after the election
showed changes in ballots cast in 109 of the 250 precincts, and changes in
votes cast for at least one of the candidates in 161 of those precincts.</p>

<p>* Gwinnett County, GA; Nov., 1986: The differences between results obtained
on different computers reading the same ballots indicates the limitations of
pre-scored punch cards in their ability to provide reproducible results.</p>

<p>* Moline, IL; April, 1985: Apparently, a slipping timing belt caused the
reader to read incorrectly. The failure to provide for a partial manual recount
(see above) or for sufficient pre-election testing (see above) prevented
identification of the problem in a timely manner.</p>

<p>* Oklahoma County, OK; Nov., 1986: The ballot readers could not read up to
11% of ballots cast in some precincts.</p>

<p>* Palm Beach County, FL; Nov., 1984: The changes in votes cast on successive
tallies of the same punch card ballots, probably due to the presence of chad,
reduced the confidence of the losing candidate in the validity of the reported
outcome.</p>

<p>* Stark County, OH; May, 1986: The final (third) count of ballots verified
the first count, excepting that the results were slightly different due to chad
fallout or deliberate removal of hanging chad by the inspection boards. </p>

<p>4.13.5 Inadequate Security and Management Control</p>

<p>* Elkhart, IN, Nov., 1982: Vote-tallying was done in a borrowed facility
with equipment and employees not under management control. Multiprogrammed
computer operations independent of vote-tallying and not under management
control were being carried out while vote-tallying proceeded. A vendor
representative was permitted to operate the vote-tallying process, and to
change control cards without adequate documentation, and without regard to
requirements for re-testing.</p>

<p>4.13.6 Inadequate Contingency Planning</p>

<p>* Oklahoma County, OK; Nov., 1986: No administrative rules were available to
allow the counting of the significant number of ballots that could not be
counted by machine. Many voters were disenfranchised.</p>

<p>* Salt Lake County, UT; Nov., 1980: No backup was available when one of two
computers failed during ballot counting. The result was a count much slower
than expected.</p>

<p>4.13.7 Inadequate System Acceptance Procedures</p>

<p>* Oklahoma County, OK; Nov., 1986: The system procured was not adequately
tested prior to acceptance. There was inadequate preparation to deal with the
failures that later occurred.</p>

<p><b>5. <u>APPLYING INTERNAL CONTROL TO COMPUTERIZED ELECTIONS<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p>Many offices of election administration have not dealt with questions of
accuracy, integrity, and security in a systematic manner. It appears that in
many situations, responses to problems and concerns of this type have been on a
case-by-case basis. Responses are even more fractionated when questions of
accuracy, integrity, and security are treated separately.</p>

<p>The discipline of internal control, covering all of these factors from a
management point of view, has not been systematically applied to the
operational aspects of election administration. This is not surprising, since
election services are not priced for sale to its users, as are privately
supplied services. Internal control has not been systematically applied in
operational situations where transactions between an organization and its
clients cannot be measured in money.</p>

<p>A proposed minimal extension in concept, described below in section 5.4.4,
makes internal control applicable to election services. With this change, the systematic
techniques of internal control may be used. Persons knowledgeable in the
discipline may be employed or consulted to ensure the competent and coordinated
application of appropriate techniques. The result should be the achievement of
increased confidence in election outcomes.</p>

<p>5.1 <u>Internal Control And Computer Security<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>In the past, internal control has been treated as a subject separate from
computer security. An example of the earlier treatment is in Federal
Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 31, <u>Guidelines for
Automatic Data Processing Physical Security and Risk Management</u> [81]. This
1974 publication (which remains pertinent at this time) has a separate section
on internal control that is distinct from sections covering contingency
planning and physical security. This treatment of internal control was adopted
in the 1975 vote-tallying report, and in that report, also, a separate section
on internal control was inserted to cover separation of duties and management
of the program development process [82]. The distinction made in these reports
is not surprising, in view of the disparate origins of the concepts of internal
control and computer security. Internal control originated in accounting, while
the source of computer security is computer science, itself an outgrowth of
electrical engineering and mathematics. </p>

<p>A more recent treatment considers the two subjects in a more connected
manner. A publication with a different understanding of the interconnected
nature of the two subjects is entitled <u>Work Priority Scheme for EDP Audit
and Computer Security Review</u>. As stated in this 1986 report:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>Security must be recognized as only one, albeit a
major category of internal controls. ...computer security controls are a <u>subset</u>
of the internal controls found in an automated information system. The major
difference between these two sets of controls is that internal controls address
efficiency and effectiveness <u>in addition to</u> security issues. [83]</p>

<p>Thus, in this study (and in much professional auditing literature), internal
control is interpreted to encompass all controls, including computer security
controls, used to ensure confidence in organizational systems. However, a need
for distinctions between kinds of controls remains -- to facilitate their
understanding and because various types of controls require specialized
knowledge to assure their effective implementation.</p>

<p>5.2 <u>Internal Control As Control Of Assets<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Internal control is a management tool used within an organization. In the
Federal Government, each department and agency is required to establish and
maintain an adequate system of internal control under the Budgeting and
Accounting Procedures Act (also called the Accounting and Auditing Act) of
1950. Requirements for applying internal control have been updated since 1950,
with the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982.</p>

<p>One view of internal control is that it is for the purpose of controlling
financial transactions and the use of tangible assets (primarily funds and
property) in an organization. This concept of internal control is typified by
the following definition, taken from the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity
Act, and quoted in Circular No. A-123 (Revised) of the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget (OMB):</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>The plan of organization and methods and
procedures adopted by management to provide reasonable assurance that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>* obligations and costs are in compliance with
applicable law;</p>

<p>* funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against waste, loss,
unauthorized use, or misappropriation; and </p>

<p>* revenues and expenditures applicable to agency operations are properly
recorded and accounted for to permit the preparation of accounts and reliable
financial and statistical reports and to maintain accountability over the
assets. [84]</p>

<p>For an office of election administration, internal control as defined above
may be immediately applied to assure that computers owned by the organization
are not stolen or misappropriated or, for example, to assure that the goods
procured under purchase orders have actually been delivered. However, internal
control as defined above is not applicable to non-financial operations such as
vote-tallying, and this omission has created difficulties that need to be
rectified. The public must have the same confidence in reported election
results that it has in the reported status of its individual bank accounts.</p>

<p>5.3 <u>Voting And Banking Operations: Accounting Similarities<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The similarity of accounting problems in voting and in banking have been
noted elsewhere. In the 1975 vote-tallying report, it was stated that:</p>

<p>The problem of assuring correctness and security of vote-tallying programs
is not significantly different than assuring correctness and security of
computer programs used for sensitive financial and record-keeping purposes.
Technical safeguards and management techniques developed for other applications
can be adopted for vote-tallying programs. [85]</p>

<p>However, the similarity in control techniques is more widespread than just
in computer programs. As noted by Ms. Suzan N. Kesim in the Texas legislative
hearings (section 2.8.3):</p>

<p>&quot;Whether you are adding dollars or votes, you can apply many of the
same auditing standards.... Many of the computer auditing procedures used by
the banking industry that have been tried and true could easily be modified or
used as they are for auditing elections.... &quot;</p>

<p>In U.S. banking operations, the currency unit is the &quot;dollar,&quot;
while in another nation, the currency unit may be the &quot;pound,&quot;
&quot;mark,&quot; &quot;franc,&quot; &quot;yen,&quot; or something else. The concepts
of internal control will not change with a different hard currency unit, and
they should not change if the currency unit is the &quot;vote.&quot;</p>

<p>The voting process is very similar to a special kind of savings bank
operation. Each candidate or issue alternative may be thought of as having an
individual savings account, with the accounts grouped into contests. Each
registered voter entering the polling place (or having an absentee ballot) may
be thought of as a qualified depositor, having the right to make deposits to
the contests for which the voter is entitled to vote. In a vote-for-one
situation, the voter may deposit only one vote in one account per contest; in a
vote-for-more-than-one situation, the voter may make deposits in more than one
account per contest, but in almost all cases, may not deposit more than one
vote per account.</p>

<p>If votes were treated as tangible assets and inherently valuable, like coins
of denomination &quot;one vote,&quot; they would be normally treated as
subjects of internal control procedures. Then, accounting for the votes that
the voters deposited could be carried out, and would be carried out as a matter
of ordinary accounting practice. Each voter would have received the coins to be
deposited at the assigned polling place, as part of the sign-in process. Each
voter would have been previously approved as a depositor by virtue of having
met certain qualifications such as those relating to age, citizenship, and
residency.</p>

<p>Following the completion of the voting process, an internal auditor (a person
who reviews the implementation and adequacy of internal controls) would be
concerned with the assurance that none of the coins used were counterfeit, that
persons receiving the coins to be cast as votes were truly qualified to receive
them, and that the recorded account balances were correct according to the
rules of the depositing process. To assure that account balances were correct,
as well as to assure the return of the tangible assets, it would be necessary
to account for the use and disposition of all coins, including those not voted
for any candidate (undervotes), and those not voted according to the rules
concerning number of votes per contest (overvotes). </p>

<p>Thus, one method of ensuring the applicability of internal control to
vote-tallying is to treat votes as tangible assets. With this conception,
controls may be applied to assure that only qualified voters are entitled to
vote, and to assure that a full accounting is made of the disposition of all
the votes distributed for use. With the use of internal control techniques in
this manner, vote-tallying would be able to achieve the confidence of the
public. </p>

<p>It may be noted that, in at least one way, voting is a more difficult
process to audit than banking. In voting, the depositor (voter) is not given a
record of his or her own account. Thus, the help that the depositors normally
provide to the auditors in the verification of account statements cannot be
present. Other verification techniques, such as manual recounting, must be used
in vote-tallying to substitute for the inability of the voter to be of
assistance for this purpose.</p>

<p>A more generic way of making internal control applicable to election
administration, without the need to consider votes as tangible assets, is given
immediately below. This change in concept would permit both voter registration
and the voting process to be considered as subjects of internal control.</p>

<p>5.4 <u>The GAO Concept Of Internal Control<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>With the passage of the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982,
the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) was required, under the act, to
develop and publish standards for the application of internal control in the
Federal Government [86]. There is nothing in these standards that would
restrict them to the Federal level, and with a broader definition of the term
&quot;transaction,&quot; they are applicable to any governmental function such
as election administration. The GAO concept of internal control is used here,
rather than other models, because it appears most appropriate for governmental
operations.</p>

<p>In its publication, the GAO provided four purposes of internal control and a
somewhat different definition of internal control than that given above. The
GAO noted also that ultimate responsibility for good internal controls rests
with management.</p>

<p>5.4.1 Purposes of Internal Control</p>

<p>The purposes of internal control identified by the GAO are as follows:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>* <u>To help regulate and guide operations</u>:
Internal controls are not specialized systems within an agency. They should be
recognized as an integral part of each system that management uses to regulate
and guide its operations.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>* <u>To achieve proper conduct with accountability</u>:
Internal controls are essential for achieving the proper conduct of Government
business with full accountability for the resources made available.</p>

<p>* <u>To prevent undesired actions</u>: Internal controls facilitate the
achievement of management objectives by serving as checks and balances against
undesired actions.</p>

<p>* <u>To achieve positive aims</u>: Internal controls help achieve the
positive aims of program managers.</p>

<p>It can be understood, from these purposes, that it is possible to view
internal control from a broader perspective than just control of obligations
and costs, and the safeguarding of assets. The purpose of achievement of
positive aims provides an additional viewpoint for internal control: the
effective execution of programs.</p>

<p>5.4.2 GAO Definition of Internal Control</p>

<p>The definition of internal control provided by the GAO is as follows:</p>

<p>The plan of organization and methods and procedures adopted by management to
ensure that:</p>

<p>* resource use is consistent with laws, regulations, and policies;</p>

<p>* resources are safeguarded against waste, loss, and misuse; and that</p>

<p>* reliable data are obtained, maintained, and fairly disclosed in reports.</p>

<p>The significant difference between this definition and the OMB definition
provided in section 5.2 above is that the GAO definition is concerned with
&quot;resource use&quot; whereas the OMB definition is concerned with
&quot;obligations and costs.&quot; Resources include personnel, and while some
personnel may be part of a production process that converts tangible raw
materials into tangible product, an important function of personnel in
government is decision making. Internal control must be concerned with decision
making, if it is concerned with the &quot;proper conduct&quot; of government
business, the prevention of &quot;undesired actions&quot; and the achievement
of &quot;positive aims.&quot; </p>

<p>In election administration, some important decisions concern design and use
of a voter registration system; procurement, acceptance, and deployment of
vote-tallying equipment; scheduling of events to assure election readiness;
ballot design; computer security; audit trails; the system for results
dissemination and documentation; and the certification of winners.</p>

<p>Government operations often convert data into decisions, a process
qualitatively different than manufacturing. In such a government operation, the
real inputs and outputs have little economic relationship to the tangible
materials (data storage media and computers) used. The data and decisions often
have significant economic value and economic consequences, but these cannot be
measured by the costs of the media and computers on which the data and
decisions are recorded and processed. Thus, internal control, if it is to be
maximally useful, cannot be based solely on safeguarding the tools of
production. It must be concerned with the operational activity and the
formation of the decisions that are the real products of the organization.</p>

<p>5.4.3 GAO General Standards</p>

<p>The internal control standards that the GAO specified are divided into two
classes: general standards, and specific standards. The standards are intended
to apply to all operations and administrative functions in an agency. In
addition, the GAO specified that there should be prompt resolution of any
finding or recommendation made by internal auditors that concerns an identified
deficiency in internal control.</p>

<p>The general standards provide the foundation without which implementation of
internal control would not be possible. The five general standards (identified
below with the letter &quot;G&quot;) can apply to any government agency, and
are as follows:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>G1. <u>Reasonable Assurance</u>: Internal control
systems are to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the systems
will be accomplished.</p>

<p>This standard implies that the cost of internal control should not exceed
the benefit derived. Thus, to determine a reasonable expenditure on internal
control, an agency must identify the vulnerabilities inherent in operations,
establish the level of risk (high, medium, or low) for each vulnerability, and
determine the acceptable level of risk under varying circumstances.
(Vulnerabilities of different vote-tallying systems were identified in chapter
3.)</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>G2. <u>Supportive Attitude</u>: Managers and
employees are to maintain and demonstrate a positive and supportive attitude
toward internal controls at all times.</p>

<p>A positive and supportive attitude is ensured when internal controls are a
consistently high management priority. General leadership is critical to
maintaining a positive and supportive attitude toward internal control.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>G3. <u>Competent Personnel</u>: Managers and
employees are to have personal and professional integrity and are to maintain a
level of competence that allows them to accomplish their assigned duties, as
well as understand the importance of developing and implementing good internal
controls.</p>

<p>Managers who possess a good understanding of internal controls are vital to
effective control systems. Individuals should be given the necessary formal and
on-the-job training.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>G4. <u>Control Objectives</u>: Internal control
objectives are to be identified or developed for each agency activity and are
to be logical, applicable, and reasonably complete.</p>

<p>Agency control systems may be classified into management, financial,
programmatic, and administrative. Control objectives should be tailored to the
specific responsibilities of each agency.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>G5. <u>Control Techniques</u>: Internal control
techniques are to be effective and efficient in accomplishing their internal
control objectives.</p>

<p>Internal control techniques are the mechanisms by which control objectives
are achieved. Techniques include policies, procedures, plans of organization,
and physical arrangements. To be effective, techniques should fulfill their
intended purpose in actual application. To be efficient, techniques should be
designed to derive maximum benefit with minimum effort. Efficient
implementations make possible lower risks (see general standard G1) since a
more efficient implementation implies a higher degree of control at the same or
lower cost.</p>

<p>5.4.4 The Concept of a Non-Financial Transaction</p>

<p>In order to apply the GAO specific standards to the voting process, the
traditional definition of &quot;transaction&quot; needs to be extended.
According to the <u>Handbook of EDP Auditing</u> [87], transactions are:</p>

<p>business events that can be measured in money and are entered in the
accounting records.</p>

<p>In election administration, and in other services that are not priced for
sale, the product of the organization is not measured in money. As pointed out
above, it is decisions that define the process of election administration. Some
of the decisions that personally concern the voter or the candidate include the
following: registration of a voter, the removal of a voter's name from the
registration file, the tender of a ballot (or the offer of the use of a DRE
machine) to a voter at a polling location, and the certification of a contest
result following the counting of the ballots.</p>

<p>These decisions concern the implementation of entitlements, specifically,
entitlements to vote and to certification as a winner. The completion of the
entitlement depends on satisfaction of certain necessary conditions. Some of
the conditions may be voluntary, e.g., signing in at the polling place on
election day, and others may be mandatory, e.g., receiving more votes than any
opponent. Other non-priced operations (not necessarily in election
administration) may be concerned with obligations, rather than with
entitlements. Thus, a definition for a <u>non-financial transaction</u> is
proposed as follows:</p>

<p>an event, occurring in the course of organizational activity, that consists
of a step in the implementation of an entitlement or an obligation and that is
entered in the official records.</p>

<p>5.4.5. GAO Specific Standards</p>

<p>With this change in the concept of a transaction, the following six GAO
specific standards for internal control (identified by the letter &quot;S&quot;
to contrast with the general standard given above) are presented here for their
application in election administration:</p>

<p>S1. <u>Documentation</u>: Internal control systems and all transactions and
other significant events are to be clearly documented, and the documentation is
to be readily available for examination.</p>

<p>According to the GAO, documentation of transactions or other significant
events should be complete and accurate and should facilitate tracing the
transaction or event and related information from before it occurs, while it is
in process, and after it is completed. Here, support may be inferred for audit
trails in vote-tallying, and for providing complete documentary support for a
decision to certify the result of a contest.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>S2. <u>Recording of Transactions and Events</u>:
Transactions and other significant events are to be promptly recorded and
properly classified.</p>

<p>This standard extends the implementation requirements for standard S1 above.
This standard applies to the entire process or life cycle of a transaction or
event, including its authorization, initiation, processing, and final
recording.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>S3. <u>Execution of Transactions and Events</u>:
Transactions and other significant events are to be authorized and executed
only by persons acting within the scope of their authority.</p>

<p>This standard provides support for assurance that only approved activities
will be carried out. It provides a basis for the formalization of relationships
between an election administration and its vendors, so that the activities
carried out by a vendor during any election-related operation are fully
authorized and controlled.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>S4. <u>Separation of Duties</u>: Key duties and
responsibilities in authorizing, processing, recording, and reviewing
transactions should be separated among individuals.</p>

<p>To reduce risks, no one individual should control all key aspects of a
transaction or event. Duties and responsibilities should be assigned
systematically to a number of individuals to ensure that effective checks and
balances exist. An example of this in election administration is the use of
members of more than one party to serve jointly as election judges at precincts.
Separation of responsibilities for computer program design and for computer
operation is another example.</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>S5. <u>Supervision</u>: Qualified and continuous
supervision is to be provided to ensure that internal control objectives are
achieved.</p>

<p>This standard requires that supervisors provide their staffs with the
necessary guidance and training to help ensure that errors, waste, and wrongful
acts are minimized and that specific management directives are achieved. To
carry out this standard, expertise in internal control must be available in the
organization. This need is considered further in section 5.6.</p>

<p>S6. <u>Access to and Accountability for Resources</u>: Access to resources
and records is to be limited to authorized individuals, and accountability for
the custody and use of resources is to be assigned and maintained. Periodic
comparison shall be made of the resources with the recorded accountability to
determine whether the two agree. The frequency of the comparison shall be a
function of the vulnerability of the asset.</p>

<p>This standard applies to tangible resources, for example, vote-tallying
equipment, computer programs, and blank ballots. Blank ballots that have been
printed for a specific election, in anticipation of the election, are similar
to blank checks in their vulnerability. The GAO identifies blank checks as a
type of resource which should be protected by being kept physically safe,
having each separate document assigned a sequential number, and by assigning
custodial accountability to responsible individuals. By analogy, blank ballots
for a forthcoming election should be similarly treated. For computer programs,
the working copies similarly should be kept physically safe, custodial
accountability should be assigned, and the working copies should be compared
with reference copies to assure complete agreement.</p>

<p>5.5 <u>A Classification Of Internal Controls<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>A classification of internal controls is provided here in order to more
specifically describe the application of the concept. In addition, certain
specific recommendations of this report will be shown to be consistent with
internal control techniques of a particular type.</p>

<p>Internal controls are divided into internal accounting controls and
administrative controls. Internal accounting controls, which of primary interest,
are divided into general controls and application controls. General controls
concern the preparation of systems for the carrying out of operations, and may
be called integrity controls. Application controls concern the actual
processing of documents and data in the course of operations.</p>

<p>5.5.1 General Controls</p>

<p>These are the controls over computing and vote-tallying hardware, software,
and facilities, but not the actual processing of votes or of changes to the
voter registration files. Hardware, software, and facilities concern both
precinct locations and central locations. Specific categories of control
include the following, where the titles in parentheses refer to similar
categories identified and discussed in the <u>Handbook of EDP Auditing</u>
[88]. Particular category definitions used here may be somewhat different, so
that they apply more specifically to election preparations):</p>

<p><u>Access Controls</u> (Data file security controls): These controls concern
physical access to the computing and vote-tallying site or sites, electronic
access through terminals and communications links, and access to separate data
files, such as for voter registration. The controls are for the purpose of
assuring that only authorized accesses are made, and only for authorized purposes.</p>

<p><u>Development and Implementation Controls</u> (Implementation controls):
These controls are for the purpose of assuring that the hardware and software
of new systems, and authorized changes to existing systems, are correctly
implemented and contain all necessary features (or meet
certification/acceptance criteria in the case of procured hardware and
software). These controls also concern assurance that all necessary
preparations have been made for a computerized election, including
specialization of software.</p>

<p><u>System Controls</u> (System software controls): These controls are for
the purpose of assuring that no unauthorized modifications are made to system
hardware or software. System software consists of operating systems, compilers,
and other computer programs not specific to any application. System hardware
includes vote-tallying computers or devices of any type.</p>

<p><u>Application Software Controls</u> (Program security controls): These
controls are for the purpose of assuring that no unauthorized modifications are
made to application software already in use.</p>

<p><u>Computer Operations Controls</u> (Computer operations controls): These
controls provide an audit trail for operation of the computing and
vote-tallying devices, and concern the assurance of adequate backup and
recovery procedures in case of malfunction.</p>

<p>5.5.2 Application Controls</p>

<p>These controls apply to the processing of documents and data in the course
of the voter registration and vote-tallying processes. As above, titles in
parentheses refer to similar categories identified and discussed in the <u>Handbook
of EDP Auditing</u> [89]. As above, particular category definitions may be
somewhat different, so that they apply more specifically to election
operations):</p>

<p><u>Input Controls</u> (Controls for completeness and accuracy of input):
Completeness refers to the processing of each input document once and only
once, while accuracy refers to the correct entry of the data on each document.
In voting, completeness of input concerns controls over the voter sign-in
process at precincts (e.g., to match number of voters against ballots issued),
distribution and accounting for use of all ballots, the collection and
transportation of voted ballots for processing, and the assurance that ballots
are entered for counting once and only once. Accuracy of input in voting
concerns the ability of the vote-tallying equipment to accurately read each
ballot (or set of voter choices in a DRE system), and to accurately send and
receive communicated precinct summaries. In registration, input controls are
for the purpose of assuring the correctness of the entry of changes into the
system that holds the list of registered voters.</p>

<p><u>Validity Controls</u> (Validity controls): These controls help to prevent
two types of problems: invalid input documents and invalid data on the documents.
Controls to prevent counterfeit ballots may be considered to be in this
category. In vote-tallying, these controls could help prevent a mixup in
assigning ballots to an incorrect precinct during tallying. In registration,
these controls could help identify voter addresses that do not exist, or are
outside of a specified range.</p>

<p><u>Processing Controls</u> (Controls for completeness and accuracy of
update): In vote-tallying, these controls assist in the verification of the
correctness of the results. If proper ballot accounting has been done (see
Input Controls above), then reconciliation of votes cast with ballots cast can
be accomplished, provided that records are kept on undervotes and overvotes.
Recounting may be considered to be a control in this category. In registration,
these controls provide assurance that the intended changes to the files have
been carried out correctly. In registration, no arithmetic checks on summary
data can be made, since the data is not being counted, like votes or money.
However, the number of registered voters at the end of the day must be
consistent with the number of registered voters at the beginning of the day,
given a particular number of registered voters added and deleted.</p>

<p><u>File Maintenance Controls</u> (Control techniques employed for
maintenance): This type of control helps assure currency of data in the
registration file, and supporting geographic, geocoding, and postal information
files. It does not apply to vote-tallying.</p>

<p>5.6 <u>The Discipline Of Internal Control</u> </p>

<p>5.6.1 Link to a Professional Body of Knowledge</p>

<p>Internal control is a professional body of knowledge that is known, taught,
and applied by internal auditors and EDP (electronic data processing) auditors.
Professional associations that are concerned with the subject of internal
control include the </p>

<p>American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, 1211 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, NY 10036, (phone: 212-575-6700);</p>

<p>Institute of Internal Auditors, 249 Maitland Avenue, Altamonte Springs, FL
32701, (phone: 407-830-7600); and the</p>

<p>EDP Auditors Association, 455 Kehoe Boulevard, Carol Stream, IL 60188
(phone: 312-682-1200).</p>

<p>Since internal control is part of a professional body of knowledge, the
concepts and application of internal control can be learned in an organized, consistent,
and uniform manner by elections personnel. Publications, both professional
journals and textbooks, are widely available. Professional conferences are held
annually or more often.</p>

<p>5.6.2 Job Functions for Internal Control</p>

<p>The need for implementation of internal control concepts could be satisfied
by the establishment of appropriate job functions in the office of election
administration. Examples of appropriate job functions are given in <u>Guide to
Auditing for Controls and Security: A System Development Life Cycle Approach</u>
[90], a publication of the National Bureau of Standards. This publication
identifies separate &quot;internal control officer&quot; and &quot;system
security officer&quot; positions. The publication envisions that, in a large
government department, there would be senior officer positions at the
department level, and separate &quot;specialist&quot; positions at the
operational level, but this concept may not be applicable to an office of
election administration in a local government. In local government, it may be advisable,
due to budgetary and workload constraints, to fold in the &quot;system security
officer&quot; responsibilities into the &quot;internal control officer&quot;
position. A person in data processing, knowledgeable in computer security,
could be trained in the additional techniques of internal control to occupy
this position.</p>

<p>The responsibilities of the &quot;internal control officer&quot; might be
specified as follows:</p>

<p>The <u>internal control officer</u> (ICO) establishes internal control
(including computer security) policies and ensures that operational systems
comply with these policies. The ICO assures that each operational system meets
basic standards for documentation, recording of transactions, execution of
transactions, separation of duties, access to resources, and all other internal
control requirements.</p>

<p>In addition to the ICO, the employment of an internal auditor could be
considered. Typically, the internal auditor reports to the senior management
official, or to the board of directors. The function of the internal auditor is
to independently review the implementation of controls and provide reasonable
assurance to senior management that the organization is functioning adequately
with regard to legal requirements, management policies, internal controls,
audit trails, documentation, and economy and efficiency.</p>

<p>If the election administration cannot fund these positions full time, then
discussions could be held with other agencies of the same local government to
consider the possibility of jointly funding the positions. The local government
could consider itself equivalent to the department for which a complement of
positions are envisioned in the reference [90] identified above.</p>

<p>State-level support for these positions is another possibility. Joint
funding or State-level support might engender a wide review of computer
security policy and implementation activity, a worthwhile activity in any
event.</p>

<p><b>6. <u>DETAILED CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS<o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p>The conclusions and recommendations presented in this chapter cover three
general areas: institutional concerns; hardware and software performance,
design, and integrity; and operational procedures. Institutional concerns are
considered in sections 6.1 through 6.6. Hardware and software are covered in
sections 6.7 through 6.12. Operational procedures are discussed in sections
6.13 through 6.17. In the final section, 6.18, the recommendations are shown to
be responsive to specific problems of computerized vote-tallying identified in
section 2.9. </p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><u>INSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS</u>
</p>

<p>6.1 <u>The Continuing Problem Of Confidence In Results</u> </p>

<p>Consultants' evaluations of a vote-tallying program, quoted in the <u>New
York Times</u> article on July 29, 1985 [6], as well as testimony on November
25, 1986 before a committee of the Texas legislature (section 2.8.3 above),
have demonstrated that technically trained individuals continue to find
significant vulnerabilities in vote-tallying software and hardware. Results of
computerized elections continue to be challenged, and regardless of the
outcomes of these challenges, it has been clearly shown that audit trails that
document election results, as well as general practices to assure accuracy,
integrity, and security, can be considerably improved. </p>

<p>Technically qualified consultants employed in some election challenges have
stated that &quot;it would be possible&quot; to alter computer programs used in
those situations. While proof of actual manipulation appears to be lacking,
documentation conclusively demonstrating otherwise is insufficient, due to the
manner in which the challenged elections, and others, have been conducted. </p>

<p>In the 1975 vote-tallying report, it was stated that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>The assurance that steps are being taken by
election officials to prevent unauthorized computer program alteration or other
computer-related manipulations remains, nationwide, a problem for the
maintenance of public confidence in the election process. [91]</p>

<p>Thus, the 1975 statement remains pertinent.</p>

<p>Given the continuing problem, it is important, first, to identify the
agencies responsible for correcting the deficiencies, and second, to provide
recommendations that will assist these agencies in rectifying the situation.</p>

<p>6.2 <u>Responsibility And Requirements For The Effective Management Of
Elections<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>6.2.1 Government Responsibility</p>

<p>As discussed in section 3.9.1, responsibility for the conduct of elections
in the United States rests with local governmental agencies assigned this
function under State law (or under local law, under a grant of authority by
State law). It was stated in that section that major elections are carried out
by about 2870 county-level government agencies, and by some 7630 other local
governmental agencies. In some 1005 of the total 3140 counties and
county-equivalents, vote-tallying is completely computerized. It is partly
computerized in an additional 192 counties.</p>

<p>Typically, the local offices operate with oversight by the chief State
elections official, but the degree of oversight varies from State to State. The
local offices of election administration require the necessary resources and
expertise to efficiently and effectively carry out their responsibility. That
responsibility includes procurement of supporting equipment and services,
including vote-tallying systems. An effective procurement must include
specifications (technical descriptions of products to be procured) so that
accuracy, integrity, and security will be promoted.</p>

<p>6.2.2 Expertise and Effective Management</p>

<p>In the 1975 vote-tallying report, it was noted that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>There is a lack of expertise in computer
technology available within the structure of many local election
administrations. In jurisdictions without technological expertise, vendors are
more likely to conduct a significant part of the election on the
administration's behalf. [92]</p>

<p>To some extent, this lack of expertise continues to exist, particularly in
the smaller jurisdictions. The example of Elkhart County, Indiana, described in
section 4.4.1, is a glaring instance of the problem.</p>

<p>There is no dispute over vendor involvement in vote-tallying. As was
testified in the Texas legislative hearings by an executive of a major election
equipment vendor (section 2.8.3):</p>

<p>&quot;People are going to have the best elections that well-intentioned
honest people can run, and that well-intentioned honest companies can
run....&quot;</p>

<p>Vendor involvement may be excessive when there is a lack of local
competence. However, vendor goals are not identical to those of the responsible
public officials. Excessive involvement by a vendor, i.e., the assumption of
management prerogatives, may be in violation of GAO standards for internal
control. Pertinent GAO standards are G3 (section 5.4.3), and S3 and S5 (section
5.4.5). These are:</p>

<p>G3. <u>Competent Personnel</u>: Managers and employees are to have personal
and professional integrity and are to maintain a level of competence that
allows them to accomplish their assigned duties, as well as understand the
importance of developing and implementing good internal controls.</p>

<p>S3. <u>Execution of Transactions and Events</u>: Transactions and other
significant events are to be authorized and executed only by persons acting
within the scope of their authority.</p>

<p>S5. <u>Supervision</u>: Qualified and continuous supervision is to be
provided to ensure that internal control objectives are achieved.</p>

<p>In the 1975 vote-tallying report, it was concluded that:</p>

<p>Each State should insure that each of its local jurisdictions possesses the
necessary expertise in computer technology to carry out its statutory election
functions and does not rely primarily on vendors of election system components.
[93]</p>

<p>This recommendation remains pertinent, and now is buttressed with internal
control standards.</p>

<p>Difficulties with vendor-supplied products used in vote-tallying are often
indicators of a lack of expertise and/or lack of adequate management control in
the affected agency. In one of the <u>New York Times</u> articles on
computerized vote-tallying, it was reported that a leading computer security
expert had stated that:</p>

<p>&quot;the degree of fraud controls built into a program is largely determined
by the end user.&quot; [9]</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the State and local election administrators (the
end users) to ensure that requirements for adequate audit trails and other
fraud-prevention techniques are included in the specifications to be met by acceptable
computerized vote-tallying systems.</p>

<p>Failures in organizational use of technology often indicate failures in
management. In the <u>Report to the President</u> by the Presidential
Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident [94], it was recognized
that the immediate cause of the accident was a failure of a joint of a rocket.
However, deficiencies in management were cited as causes of the failure to
correct the design defect. The Commission reported that neither the contractor
nor the government agency &quot;responded adequately to internal warnings about
the faulty seal design,&quot; that &quot;a redefinition of the Program
Manager's responsibility is essential,&quot; and that a new office having
&quot;direct authority for safety, reliability, and quality assurance&quot;
should be established.</p>

<p>It remains true, as stated in the 1975 vote-tallying report, that:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>Technology and the management of technology are
inextricably linked. The effective use of technology requires management
control; and the effective management of technology requires the utilization of
appropriate technological expertise. [95]</p>

<p>6.2.3 Requirements</p>

<p>If each office of election administration is to effectively carry out its
responsibilities, it must have in place the necessary technological expertise
and management control systems. These supporting elements are most urgently
needed in the following three areas: (1) procurement of vote-tallying hardware
and software, (2) preparation of vote-tallying systems for elections, and (3)
execution of vote-tallying operations. To the extent that local administrations
cannot acquire the necessary knowledge and personnel, the State-level activity
should provide it.</p>

<p>6.2.4 FEC Clearinghouse Performance Specifications</p>

<p>With regard to procurements, the 1975 vote-tallying report specifically
recommended statewide specifications [96]. The FEC Clearinghouse performance
specifications [2] [3] are approaching completion (see section 2.4), and they
are intended for statewide adoption. Each State should consider the adoption of
these specifications when they are issued.</p>

<p>6.3 <u>Implementation Of An Internal Control Function<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Concepts of internal control (as extended to non-priced operations,
described in chapter 5), should be utilized by election administrators to help
assure accuracy, integrity, and security in elections. Procedures adopted for
these purposes should be consistent with and supportive of the GAO internal
control standards presented in sections 5.4.3. and 5.4.5. Many of the
recommendations made in 1975 could have been classified as internal controls,
under a newer interpretation of the subject. </p>

<p>Internal control expertise should be added to the personnel complement in
election administration to assure understanding and implementation of the
concepts. Internal control is a professional activity; training in the
discipline, texts, and a community of practitioners are available. In a small
election administration, the internal control function could be added to the
duties of the individual responsible for implementation of computer security
controls, provided that additional training is given.</p>

<p>Additional confidence in the reported results of elections could obtained if
an internal auditor was available to independently review the implementation of
internal controls and report on their effectiveness.</p>

<p>Internal control personnel could be shared with other agencies of the same
government, or provided by the State, if the election administration has
insufficient resources to offer full-time employment.</p>

<p>6.3.1 Outside Recommendations vs. In-house Expertise</p>

<p>Specific procedural recommendations to help assure accuracy, integrity, and
security were provided in the 1975 vote tallying report, and similar
recommendations are provided below. However, the failure of a significant
number of election administrations to implement the 1975 recommendations is
indicative of the need for a different kind of answer.</p>

<p>There is an essential qualitative difference between the availability of
recommendations made in an outside consultant's report and the availability of in-house
professional expertise familiar with the necessary body of knowledge. Expertise
within the organization provides the capability to deal with questions of
accuracy, integrity, and security on a day-to-day basis, to evaluate outside
recommendations for feasibility and cost, and to implement realistic solutions
based on local conditions and the immediate situation.</p>

<p>6.3.2 Achievement of Management Goals</p>

<p>The involvement of an internal controls officer in the implementation of a
voting system, and the involvement of an internal auditor in the review of such
a system, will provide an elections administrator with additional capability to
pursue established goals. The involvement of internal control personnel should
relieve the elections administrator from having to be personally knowledgeable
about specific technical matters best left to individuals who are
professionally qualified in that field. With the necessary technical expertise
on staff, an elections administrator can retain responsibility for direction,
and can perform the required supervisory role to assure that established goals,
such as accuracy, integrity, and security, will be achieved. </p>

<p>6.3.3 Analysis of Risks and Impact on Public Confidence</p>

<p>An important function of internal control is to organize the identified
system vulnerabilities into a set of realistic threats and responses. This
activity requires the performance of a risk analysis [81]. The analysis
involves a determination of the likelihood of actual exploitation of a
particular vulnerability, identification of the potential loss or negative
impact from the executed threat, and development of proposed countermeasures
that include associated costs. A risk analysis would consider, for example, the
possibility that &quot;computers can be manipulated remotely, by wire or
radio&quot; or that &quot;the software can be set to await the receipt of a
special card, whose presence will cause all the election counters to be
altered&quot; (threats specifically identified in public testimony). </p>

<p>The result of a risk analysis and its follow-on activities would satisfy two
needs. These needs are, first, for actual system protection plans, and second,
for assurances that could made to the public that the potential threats are
understood, have been prioritized for significance, and are being countered
with available measures consistent with resources.</p>

<p>Internal control personnel would be extremely valuable in responding to
questions about accuracy, integrity, and security raised by supporters of
defeated candidates or by technically trained members of the general public.
The involvement of professionally qualified internal control personnel should
provide the general public with additional confidence that a computerized
election with which these personnel have been connected has been carried out
fairly and accurately.</p>

<p>6.4 <u>Review Of The Adequacy Of State Laws And Regulations<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Each State should examine the adequacy of its laws and regulations to assure
their effectiveness in treating problems of accuracy, integrity, and security
in computerized vote-tallying.</p>

<p>6.4.1 Revised Texas Statute on Electronic Voting Systems</p>

<p>At a minimum, the requirements of the revised Texas statute on electronic
voting systems should be considered for adoption in those States that have not
already adopted equivalent provisions. Provisions of the Texas statute include
requirements for audit trails, deposit of computer programs with the secretary
of state, assurance that the programs used in vote-tallying are identical to
those deposited, mandatory one percent manual recount of all contests, testing
of equipment using all applicable ballot formats, disconnect of remote
terminals during vote tabulation, and specific scrutiny of ballot count
discrepancies when they occur at precinct locations (see section 2.8.4).</p>

<p>6.4.2 Effective Use of Technical Terminology</p>

<p>In connection with the examination of laws and regulations, a review should
be undertaken of the technical terminology employed. The latter review should
assure that the use of such terminology is clear, and is consistent with
current concepts.</p>

<p>6.5 <u>Future Vote-Tallying Systems<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>While vote-tallying using on-line systems (e.g., through telephones or
stations similar to automatic teller machines) is technologically feasible, the
decision to implement such systems must be based on more fundamental factors.
The principal issues should be political and social concerns, as well as
concerns for the benefits compared with the costs.</p>

<p>Any installed system must meet several basic political requirements, in
addition to technical requirements of accuracy and reliability. The political
requirements include equal access by individuals to the voting franchise, the
ability to verify registration, the ability of voters to vote in secret without
intimidation, assurance of fairness to opposing parties, and the ability to
demonstrate, through audit trails and other internal controls, that the
announced results are correct. The benefits of the use of the advanced
technology might be greater convenience to voters and possibly greater participation.
However, the costs of providing the capacity for very high traffic over a short
time span might be prohibitive.</p>

<p>6.6 <u>Transfer Of Technical Knowledge To Election Officials<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Technical knowledge that can be collected and made available on a national
basis needs to be transferred to election officials. The activity of
information dissemination being carried out by the Election Center (see section
2.5) should be expanded. Election officials need sources of knowledge in new
and improved techniques of management, including those that would assist in the
solution of problems of procurement and operations. The need for sources of
technical knowledge has been previously recognized:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;State election officials agree generally on
the need to upgrade election procedures by providing more technical guidance to
local officials, particularly in such areas as the utilization of electronic
data processing techniques.&quot; [97]</p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><u>HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
PERFORMANCE, DESIGN, AND INTEGRITY<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>6.7 <u>Adoption Of FEC Clearinghouse Concepts For Product Acceptance<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Acceptance procedures for hardware and software should be consistent with
the FEC Clearinghouse implementation plan [4] involving qualification and
certification prior to final acceptance. Qualification implies conformance with
standards and functional requirements. It may be done for a vendor by an
independent testing laboratory in order to satisfy the requirements of many
States with a single set of tests. Certification is a State approval process;
it ensures that the product meets State requirements. Acceptance testing is
performed at the local government level; it evaluates the degree to which the
specific units delivered conform to the characteristics of the product that
were approved under qualification and certification.</p>

<p>6.8 <u>Software Certification, Performance, And Integrity<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>6.8.1 Certification of Software</p>

<p>Products to be certified should include all software that is to be used in
connection with vote-tallying. This software includes operating systems,
compilers, and other utility programs that run with application programs.
Application programs include software for specializing vote-tallying programs
for a particular election, and the vote-tallying programs themselves. The
software should include system programs that compile source application
programs to object code. If an election management package is to run on a
computer at the same time as specialization or vote-tallying software, that
package should be certified at the same time.</p>

<p>6.8.2 Requirements for Certification</p>

<p>Requirements for certification should include one type of assurance for all
software and a second type only for vote-tallying software. All software should
be checked for integrity, that is, for the ability to carry out its asserted
function and to contain no hidden code. Vote-tallying software should be
tested, in addition, for logical correctness. Software testing may be part of a
qualification process, done once, that is acceptable to many States.</p>

<p>6.8.3 Integrity of Software</p>

<p>Separate copies of all computer software, such as the operating system,
compiler, and other needed utility programs, as well as vote-tallying software,
should be obtained from general suppliers from a stock of publicly offered
products, or should be written in-house. With each procured software product,
complete documentation of its functions should be obtained. Assurances should
be received from each supplier that the copies obtained perform no other
function than that stated in documentation of the products. </p>

<p>Assurances may be simple written statements, or detailed statements
specifying the function of each major program segment. In addition, tests may
be performed to demonstrate the correctness of the assertions.</p>

<p>For support software, such as operating systems, available resources may
limit the tests that can be performed to assure integrity. Qualification, done
once to satisfy many States, may enable testing resources to stretch further.
If available resources severely restrict integrity testing, written statements
by the manufacturer and documentation of functions may be all the assurance
that can be achieved. Thus, reliability and accountability of the sources are
essential. Copying of software from unaccountable sources must be forbidden.</p>

<p>6.8.4 Dedicated Operation and Use</p>

<p>An important procedure to assure system integrity is to isolate
vote-tallying and support software from influences over which the election
administration has no control.</p>

<p>Any routine (even a simple routine used to copy files) that operates on any
vote-tallying program should be maintained separately under the control of the
election administration and not used for any other purpose except in connection
with vote-tallying.</p>

<p>When vote-tallying software is run on a general-purpose computer in which
there is no control over the other applications or support software that are
also being run, a review for hidden code is not useful. Hidden code may be
present in other software that is not reviewed, and may be transferred to the
vote-tallying software as a &quot;computer virus.&quot; Thus, it is strongly
recommended that vote-tallying software not be allowed to run on a
multiprogrammed general-purpose computer. The restriction to dedicated
operation and use were recommended in the 1975 vote-tallying report. [98]</p>

<p>For vote-tallying with DRE machines, running of any software related to
vote-tallying together with other software that has not been reviewed for
hidden code should be prohibited. With DRE systems, freedom from hidden code of
all software associated in any way with vote-tallying must be guaranteed. There
are no ballots that can be recounted as a check on system correctness.</p>

<p>6.8.5 Logical Correctness of Vote-Tallying Software</p>

<p>For vote-tallying software (including software for election specialization
and ballot generation, as well as vote-summarizing software), certification
implies assurance of logical correctness: for example, in implementation of
ballot position assignments in ballot generation, in translation of voters'
choices to storage, in summation of voters' choices regardless of rotation, and
in implementation of State logical rules such as for overcoming and crossover
voting. No requirement for certification of logical correctness is implied for
other types of software.</p>

<p>6.8.6 Design for Specialization and Prevention of Logic Changes</p>

<p>After software has been certified, no changes should be permitted without a
re-certification. Vote-tallying software should be designed so as to require
that specialization occur only by a &quot;fill-in-the-blanks&quot; process in
tables. This concept was presented in the 1975 vote-tallying report under
&quot;Use of Table-Driven Programs.&quot; [99]</p>

<p>It should be noted that the use of &quot;header cards&quot; in vote-tallying
operations constitutes part of the specialization process. Data provided to the
program by header cards should only fill in blanks in tables and should not
change program logic. As noted in the 1975 vote-tallying report, a complete
audit trail of operations would have to include &quot;capability to copy out on
the output printer the exact contents of each header and other control card
read at the input...&quot; [100]</p>

<p>6.8.7 Deposit and Availability of Certified Software</p>

<p>All software that has been certified should be deposited with the chief
election official of the State. The materials on file should not be public
information, but should be made available to law enforcement authorities, on
proper application, for investigation of election irregularities.</p>

<p>6.9 <u>Accuracy Of Ballot Reading<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The problems found in ballot reader inaccuracy, both in the count of
ballots, and in the count of votes on the ballots, are a significant source of
lack of confidence in vote-tallying by candidates and informed observers. The
use of pre-scored punch card ballots contributes to the inaccuracy and to the
lack of confidence. In every case reported in chapter 4 in which a recount was
taken using pre-scored punch card ballots, the second vote count differed
somewhat. It is generally not possible to exactly duplicate a count obtained on
pre-scored cards, given the inherent physical characteristics of punch card
ballots and the variability in the ballot punching performance of real voters.</p>

<p>The statements made in the 1975 vote-tallying report about the need for
ballot reader accuracy included the following:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>The sensor [i.e., ballot reader], the device which
converts information on a ballot to electronic form for data processing, is one
of the key elements of a computer-based vote-tallying system. Its accuracy,
reliability, and stability over time must be assured. .... Sensor accuracy must
be considered in combination with the quality of its data input which the
voters are able to achieve given particular forms of ballots and vote-encoding
equipment. ... The effect of a sensor on the information contained on a ballot
must be minimal when the ballot is read. This is extremely important if a
ballot must be re-read or recounted. [101]</p>

<p>These statements continue to be pertinent.</p>

<p>Therefore, the following recommendations are made: </p>

<p>6.9.1 Accuracy Goal</p>

<p>A recommended goal for computerized vote counting is that the vote count produced
on a computerized ballot-tallying system should be able to be reproduced on a
recount with no more than a change in one vote for each candidate or issue
alternative in ballot quantities of up to 100,000 when machine-generated
(ideal) ballots are used. The ballot reader should be able to tolerate a wide
range of voter punching/marking behavior without a significant increase in
error. </p>

<p>6.9.2 Elimination of Pre-scored Punch Card Ballots</p>

<p>The use of pre-scored punch card ballots should be ended.</p>

<p>One method now available to eliminate pre-scored cards, while retaining the
&quot;votomatic&quot; concept, is with a new type of stylus. This stylus
permits a voter to create a hole of consistent dimensions in a ballot card
without the need for pre-scoring. A replacement for the internal construction
of the &quot;votomatic&quot; ballot holding device must be installed in
conjunction with the use of the new type of stylus. Other devices and methods
for elimination of pre-scored punch card ballots also may be effective.</p>

<p>6.9.3 Treatment of Rejected Ballots</p>

<p>Some ballot readers (primarily mark-sense readers) include a
&quot;go-no-go&quot; decision, depending on whether the reader can read the
ballot at all. Such readers may refuse to count ballots in the
&quot;no-go&quot; status. Administrative regulations should require such
rejected ballots to be counted manually, so that no voter loses the voting
franchise because of machine failure.</p>

<p>The use of the term &quot;rejected ballots,&quot; implies that none of the
ballot readers used could distinguish a hole from no-hole or mark from no-mark
at a location on a ballot at which a hole or mark indicates an intention to
cast a vote. If a ballot reader can correctly distinguish the voting intentions
made by the voter in all the appropriate locations on the ballot, it is successfully
reading the ballot (even if a voting intention cannot be counted because of an
overvote or the voter submitted an undervote by failing to vote for an office).
If the ballot is correctly read, the term &quot;rejected ballots&quot; should
not be used.</p>

<p>6.9.4 Required Research </p>

<p>Research to determine the accuracy of current ballot reading systems (such
as that now being carried out by ECRI of Plymouth Meeting, PA), and additional
research to improve ballot tallying systems from the standpoints of both
accuracy and ease of voter use, are important to pursue. The need for such
research was recognized in 1975. [102]</p>

<p>6.10 <u>Design Of DRE Machines<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>As no voter-generated records of voters' choices exist with the use of DRE
machines, and no recount of voters' choices is possible, additional steps
should be taken with these machines to assure confidence in the reported
results.</p>

<p>6.10.1 Recording of Each Undervote</p>

<p>It is recommended, therefore, that each DRE machine be designed so as to
take a positive action for every contest in which the voter fails to vote the
maximum number of times permitted. The positive action should be the recording
of a &quot;no vote&quot; for each undervote. In a vote-for-two contest, for
example, if the voter only votes for one candidate, the machine should cast one
&quot;no vote.&quot; In a vote-for-two contest, if the voter fails to vote at
all, the machine should cast two &quot;no votes.&quot; The machine should be
designed to take this action only when the voter indicates to the machine that
voting choices are complete. </p>

<p>The &quot;no vote&quot; should be recorded for each separate contest, so
that if a voter-choice set is retained, the presence of each &quot;no
vote&quot; should be clearly present as a separate indication. That is, the
&quot;no votes&quot; should not be computed in summary form as the difference of
the maximum number of votes possible less the actual number of votes cast. (If
there is an actual &quot;none of the above&quot; possibility for voter
consideration, as is the case in at least one State, the voter still may fail
to select it or otherwise make any candidate selection.)</p>

<p>The implementation of the positive &quot;no vote&quot; indicator may be
better explained if the DRE function of precisely recording the voter's choices
is considered to consist of two substeps. The first of these substeps consists
of the setting of indicators seen by the voter in response to the voter's
particular selections. If the machine is initially set up for voter use so that
each contest has a number of &quot;no vote&quot; indicators equal to the
maximum number of allowable votes in the contest, the voter's actions can be
logically treated as replacing each &quot;no vote&quot; indicator, one at a
time, with an actual candidate or issue alternative selection. (The &quot;no
vote&quot; indicators need not be seen by the voter.) If the voter fails to vote
the maximum times allowed for the ballot configuration, some &quot;no
vote&quot; indicators will remain when the voter indicates to the machine that
voting is complete.</p>

<p>The second substep occurs immediately after the voter indicates that voting
is complete; it consists of the transfer of the set of selections to a more
permanent storage. At that time, the remaining &quot;no vote&quot; indicators
that were not replaced would be transferred to permanent storage with the
actual candidate and issue alternative selections. The sum of the number of actual
votes and &quot;no votes&quot; transferred would have to be the same quantity
for every voter using the same ballot style. The presence of this constant
quantity for each voter would provide support for the supposition that the
second substep operated correctly, i.e., that the indicators resulting from the
first substep, including both actual voters' choices and unreplaced &quot;no
votes,&quot; were actually transferred to permanent storage.</p>

<p>The design of a DRE machine in this manner will provide additional
confidence that, when an undervote is seen in the results, the undervote is
actually due to the voter's choice not to vote, instead of the machine's
failure to record the voter's choice. The design will provide a distinct
improvement over the situation with a lever machine. In the use of a lever
machine, it is not possible, without an examination of the internal operation
of the mechanism, to distinguish a voter's failure to vote from the machine's
failure to record a vote.</p>

<p>The constant value of the sum of the number of unreplaced &quot;no
votes&quot; and the number of votes for candidates and issue alternatives,
provides the capability of an arithmetic cross-check on the action of the
machine (see section 6.17.3).</p>

<p>6.10.2 Retention of Voter-Choice Sets</p>

<p>Each voter-choice set (i.e., the machine's record of all choices of a voter)
should be retained in the machine on a removable, non-volatile medium, for
example, magnetic disk. Storage locations of the voter-choice sets would have
to be randomized to prevent association of a particular set of choices with a
particular voter. The retention of the voter-choice sets makes possible a
verification, on an independent machine, of the DRE machine's summation of its
recorded voters' choices (see section 6.17.4). This verification only checks the
summation process; it does not check the data entry process. By design, there
can be no independent verification of the data entry process. The latter can be
checked only by testing the machine's response to known inputs (see section
6.17.5).</p>

<p>6.10.3 Accuracy of DRE Machines</p>

<p>Analogously with ballot-tallying machines, an accuracy goal can be
established for DRE machines. For a statistical test of accuracy, a device
simulating a large number of voter selections could be used. The test would
verify that a selection of any ballot position translates to a correct
machine-produced result.</p>

<p>A goal analogous to that stated for ballot-tallying machines is that for
known selections made in up to 100,000 ballots cast, there should be a
discrepancy of no more than one vote in the results provided for any ballot
position.</p>

<p>6.11 <u>Certification Of DRE Hardware Logic<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>As there are no independent ballots that can be recounted in a DRE system,
it is essential to assure that DRE hardware logic, as well as its software, is
correct. DRE hardware should be certified for logical correctness, by
examination of the logic design and by testing under a large variety of
different conditions. A typical unit and its documentation should be deposited
with the State, under the conditions specified in section 6.8.7.</p>

<p>6.12 <u>Selection Of A Vote-Tallying System<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The discussion of chapter 3 above has demonstrated that every type of
vote-tallying system has its vulnerabilities. Every type of vote-tallying
system has relative advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>It is possible to effectively utilize any of the computerized systems
discussed in chapter 3 provided that:</p>

<p>(a) procurement specifications are well-written in accordance with required
performance, including considerations of accuracy, reliability, and recommended
design concepts;</p>

<p>(b) certification and acceptance tests are designed so that only an
acceptably performing system is acquired;</p>

<p>(c) the vote-tallying system (including personnel and back-up) is adequately
prepared, tested, and put in readiness; </p>

<p>(d) standard procedures and recommended internal controls (including audit
trails and integrity controls) are in place for voting and vote-tallying
operations; and </p>

<p>(e) administrative regulations have been designed and are in place to deal
with expected activities, as well as with any contingencies that might arise.</p>

<p><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><u>OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>6.13 <u>Pre-Election Checkout<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Lack of sufficient pre-election testing appears to be a major source of
current operational difficulty. The Illinois State Board of Elections, based on
their investigations, called for &quot;extensive&quot; pre-election testing,
and reported that &quot;the testing of computer vote tabulation systems needs
to be improved substantially&quot; (see section 4.6). This recommendation
should be heeded by election administrators. As was pointed out, similarly, in
the 1975 vote-tallying report:</p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>To the greatest extent possible, all hardware and
software to be utilized should be given a dry run simulating specific
conditions to be faced on election day and election night. [103]</p>

<p>Sufficient pre-election testing should be applied so that errors in software
specialization or in implementation of logical rules, if any, will become
obvious. A large variety of possible voting combinations should be tested. A
dry run involving key personnel is valuable, particularly in the first use of a
new system.</p>

<p>Adoption of the testing clause from the revised Texas statute on electronic
voting systems (see section 2.6.4) is recommended as a minimum standard. The
statute states that &quot;each unit of automatic tabulation equipment shall be
tested, using all applicable ballot formats...&quot;</p>

<p>6.14 <u>Implementation Of Audit Trails<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>Two types of audit trails must be distinguished. One type records steps in
the operation of computing equipment (both the operation of central equipment
by computer operators and the operation of precinct-located equipment by
precinct officials). The second type records steps in the execution of the
voting process and includes all steps from the printing and distribution of
blank ballots, through collection and processing of voted ballots, to the
summarization of precinct results.</p>

<p>Principles of internal control require that both types of audit trails be
maintained. The following statement in the revised Texas statute on electronic
voting systems is strongly supported: </p>

<p style='margin-left:1.0in'>&quot;A voting system may not be used in an
election unless the system ... is capable of providing records from which the
operation of the voting system may be audited.&quot; </p>

<p>Audit trails provide much of the documentation through which the correctness
of the reported results may be verified.</p>

<p>6.14.1 Full Ballots-Cast Data from Split Precincts</p>

<p>A &quot;split precinct&quot; is a precinct in which more than one ballot
style is used. As certain contests might appear on some ballot styles but not
on others, it is important to report ballots-cast data and corresponding voter
participation data for each split. A complete audit trail for each contest is
obtained only with the reporting of such data. Complete reporting may be simply
accomplished by designating each split a separate precinct, or special
arrangements may be made to report split data from a single precinct. It may
simplify the voter sign-in process and the reporting of voter participation if
there are separate precincts. The precincts may continue to be located at the
same polling place. </p>

<p>6.15 <u>Access Controls<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>6.15.1 Site Controls</p>

<p>Controls must be in place to restrict access of persons to sites or parts of
sites where computing equipment, blank ballots, voted ballots, and signature
lists are located. This includes locations at precincts where computers, DRE
machines, and election supplies are stored in preparation for use.</p>

<p>6.15.2 Equipment Access Controls</p>

<p>Controls should further restrict access to equipment (both central and
precinct-located) for operation or maintenance to designated individuals.
Controls on access to equipment should prevent removal or tampering with
portable components, e.g., plug-in read-only memories, removable magnetic tapes
or disks, plug-in circuit boards, etc.</p>

<p>6.15.3 Transportation and Handling Controls </p>

<p>Access to the transportation and handling of signature lists, blank ballots,
voted ballots, and removable read-only memories containing programs and
election data, must be controlled. </p>

<p>6.15.4 Voting Process Controls </p>

<p>At locations where voting takes place, controls should assure an orderly
flow of voters, not only to assist voters to quickly and efficiently complete
the process, but for security purposes. Controls should assure that no voter or
other person can tamper with, replace, or deface a &quot;votomatic&quot; ballot
insert, &quot;datavote&quot; ballot punch, or DRE ballot display, or carry away
a mark-sense marking pencil, &quot;votomatic&quot; stylus, information display,
or any other equipment or supplies needed for voting. In ballot-tallying
systems, controls should assure that only registered voters receive ballots,
and that each voter receives only one ballot and votes the ballot given. In DRE
systems, equivalently, controls should assure that only registered voters have
access to the machines, and that each voter votes only once.</p>

<p>6.15.5 Telecommunications Security Controls </p>

<p>If voting data are transmitted from a remote to a central location, controls
must be in place to assure the security of the process. The &quot;dial-out
only&quot; procedure, in which the central location dials out and verbal
communication establishes, through name and password, that the person at the
remote location is the responsible individual, is satisfactory for establishing
the connection from the central location to the remote location. More complex
controls have been given in a previously cited reference [31]. If results are
to be transmitted before the polls are closed, or if individual votes are to be
transmitted, or if the data transmitted is to be considered official, then controls
to secure the content of the message must be employed. The computer data
authentication process previously referenced [34] should be used.</p>

<p>While concern for the security of transmission is included in this section
as an access control, assurance of the accuracy of transmission is considered
to be an application internal control.</p>

<p>6.16 <u>Application Internal Controls For Ballot-Tallying Systems<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The controls in this section are similar to those proposed in the 1975
vote-tallying report under the headings of aids to audit of calculations,
effective control of ballots and computer hard-copy records, and use of
teleprocessing [104].</p>

<p>6.16.1 Controls over Blank Ballots Printed and Distributed </p>

<p>A significant problem in ballot-tallying systems is the protection of the
system against all types of ballot frauds. Controls must be instituted over the
number of blank ballots printed and the number of blank ballots distributed to
each polling location. Documentary evidence of these activities should be
retained.</p>

<p>6.16.2 Numbering of Ballot Stubs </p>

<p>One way of assuring better control over ballot distribution is to have the
ballot stubs numbered and assembled in groups (e.g., fifty or one hundred). The
assignments of ballot groups to each polling location should be recorded. The individual
ballot stub number may be recorded by a precinct official when a ballot is
issued to a voter. The stub number is used to assure that the ballot to be
voted is the same one issued.</p>

<p>6.16.3 Controls over Ballot Use </p>

<p>The number of voted ballots (of each individual type, in case each voter is
issued more than one type), must equal the number of voters that were issued
ballots (i.e., signed in to vote). At each precinct, the number of blank
ballots initially received must be equal to the sum of the ballots returned in
all categories (e.g., voted, voted but challenged, spoiled, and unused). When
the ballots from all precincts are returned to the administrative center, the
total number of all ballots returned in all categories (plus the number
unreturned by absentees) should equal the total number of all ballots
distributed to all precincts and to absentees.</p>

<p>6.16.4 Control of Ballot Validity </p>

<p>Ballots may be watermarked or otherwise made distinctive to guard against
counterfeiting. Procedures used by the manufacturer and vendor of the ballots
should be reviewed for security.</p>

<p>6.16.5 Machine-readability of Ballot's Precinct Number </p>

<p>Machine-readability of the precinct number assists in the prevention of
ballots from one precinct being mixed with or exchanged with ballots of another
precinct. The computer counting the votes must be programmed to read the
precinct number and make effective use of it, if the machine-readable
identification is to have any value. </p>

<p>This check is extremely important if &quot;votomatic&quot; cards are used,
particularly if ballot rotation (i.e., different candidate sequencing in
different precincts) is employed, or if counting of ballots of more than one
ballot style is done at the same physical location. If equal numbers of
&quot;votomatic&quot; ballots (ballots having no candidate information on them)
were exchanged between precincts using different rotations, and a check of
precinct numbers were not done, the mistake would not be discovered by a ballot
count reconciliation. The correct number of ballots would be found for each
precinct.</p>

<p>The programmed check of the ballot's precinct number also reduces the
importance of correct computer operator action in processing the ballots. With
a computerized check of precinct number, it is not necessary for the operator
to insert a &quot;header card&quot; with this information on it, provided that
the ballot style for the precinct is already recorded in the computer. If
ballot style were used as the machine-readable value, the use of a &quot;header
card&quot; would still be necessary to enable a precinct-by-precinct count, if
more than one precinct employed the same ballot style. The possibility of
operator error in using an incorrect &quot;header card&quot; is eliminated only
with use of the machine-readable precinct number.</p>

<p>6.16.6 Accuracy of Telecommunication of Voting Data </p>

<p>Telecommunication of summarized precinct tallies is being used in many
jurisdictions to speed up processing of unofficial results on election night.
For this application, slower speed and lower cost asynchronous transmission may
be used. Accuracy protection using parity checks with retransmission in case of
error is satisfactory for this application. This form of protection is
available with many modems.</p>

<p>If data is to be transmitted before the polls close, or if the transmitted
data is to be a part of official, final results, then more protection is
necessary. In these cases, the standard on computer data authentication,
previously referenced [34], should be used to assure accuracy, as well as
security, in the transmission of the data. Synchronous transmission is more
appropriate with use of computer data authentication.</p>

<p>6.16.7 Control for Vote Summarization </p>

<p>As voting results are received from specific precincts, these data are
summarized to provide candidate totals. Validity checks should be used to
assure that specific votes are not added twice, or not added to the wrong
precinct total, or not added at all. The number of ballots submitted from each
precinct, as identified by precinct officials, should be entered into the vote summarizing
system and compared against the sum of candidate votes plus overvotes and
undervotes tallied for the precinct. Any difference of more than three should
trigger a review. (Any difference at all is suspect, but given the current
limits of precinct official and ballot reader accuracy, a difference of three
may be the minimum practical.)</p>

<p>6.16.8 Vote Reconciliation by Contest</p>

<p>In each vote-for-N contest, whether N is one or any higher integer, the
number of candidate votes plus the number of undervotes must equal N times the
number of non-overvoted ballots. The number of non-overvoted ballots is the
simply the total number of ballots voted for the contest less the number of
ballots overvoted for the contest.</p>

<p>6.16.9 Recording of Undervotes and Overvotes </p>

<p>Undervotes and overvotes must be recorded if the vote summarization and
reconciliation controls specified above are to be accomplished. The effective
use of recounting also depends on the availability of this data. Recording of
this data is supportive of GAO standard S1 on <u>Documentation</u> (see section
5.4.5). </p>

<p>6.16.10 Recounting </p>

<p>A manual recount of one percent of the ballots of each contest is
recommended. The right of selection of some of the precincts to be recounted
should be granted to parties or candidates. The parties and candidates are
likely to propose those precincts about whose results they are most suspicious.
By recounting those precincts, more confidence in the final results is likely. </p>

<p>Ballots may be recounted on a different, independently managed machine
instead of being recounted by hand. Machine recounting permits a larger recount
with considerably less effort. If a backup machine is available, and that is
recommended as a good management practice, the ballots may be recounted on that
machine. Further confidence in the recount may be expected if the management of
the backup machine is independent of the organization managing the primary
machine and the vote-tallying software is supplied by a different manufacturer.
An independent organization could be considered to be one that reports to a
different independently elected or appointed official and that receives an
independent budget.</p>

<p>An analysis of recounting [105] reveals that for a given level of confidence
in the results, more ballots should be recounted as the opposing candidate vote
totals become more equal. As the candidate vote totals approach equality, the
recount percentage for any confidence level approaches 100%. This result is
what one would expect intuitively, and in practice, a full recount is often
demanded (if it is not automatic) by at least one candidate when this condition
occurs.</p>

<p>The referenced analysis employs the assumption that the number of voters
receiving and returning ballots is well-documented, so that frauds or errors
involving the addition or subtraction of ballots could not be successfully
perpetrated. Any reported result in which the sum of candidate votes (plus
overvotes and undervotes) is not equal to the number of ballots submitted can
be immediately identified as incorrect. If an erroneous result is reported in
which the total of candidate votes plus overvotes and undervotes for a precinct
equals the number of ballots submitted for that precinct, the error must be due
to a switching of votes between candidates or between a candidate and the
overvote or undervote categories. Thus, the complete reconciliation of
candidate votes and overvotes and undervotes with ballots cast reduces
significantly the possibilities for the reporting of incorrect results.</p>

<p>The referenced analysis shows that if only 1% of the precincts are recounted
(the rule in California and Texas, for example), and there are just two
opposing candidates who differ by only 1% of the total vote, there is only a
probability of .655 (a chance of about two in three) of finding a worst-case
error that might be overturning the outcome of an election involving 1000
precincts. For there to be a 99% chance of finding this worst-case error when
the candidates differ by 1% of the total vote, 4.3% of the precincts should be
recounted, assuming a 1000-precinct situation.</p>

<p>However, the kind of error that is most likely to occur is not the type of
deliberate and sophisticated scheme that would require the full percentage
recount specified in the analysis in order to be discovered. With a less
sophisticated type of error (such as the accidental miscounts in Carroll
County, Maryland and Moline, Illinois described respectively in sections 4.1
and 4.8), a smaller recount is sufficient for discovery. The reason that a
smaller recount is sufficient with less deliberate errors is that the errors
would exist more widely among the precincts, and so a smaller selection of
precincts for recounting would be necessary in order to discover the error.
Unfortunately, it is not known in advance what kind of error, if any, exists in
a reported count.</p>

<p>6.17 <u>Application Internal Controls For DRE Systems<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>The controls proposed for DRE systems in this section were not included in
the 1975 vote-tallying report, as this type of system was only just becoming
operational at that time. In the 1975 report, a DRE machine was called a
&quot;vote summarizer.&quot;</p>

<p>The DRE voting machine presents a special application internal control
problem. As discussed in section 3.7.2, a voter-choice set recorded by the
machine is not an independent document, as it is created by the machine, not by
the voter. The set of votes displayed by the machine for the benefit of the
voter during the voting process may not be the set of votes actually used by
the machine for summarization and inclusion in the reported results. By design,
there can be no independent verification of the operation of the machine. For
some, this lack of an audit trail for individual transactions is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Substitute controls for the unavailability of individual voting records
should include convincing demonstrations that each DRE machine operated
correctly, that is, did not fail, during each voter's use.</p>

<p>6.17.1 Voter Count Match </p>

<p>The number of voters recorded by each machine as having voted should equal
the number of voters signed in to vote and assigned to that machine by the
precinct officials. That is, records of use of each machine should be
individually kept by the precinct officials in order to permit a direct match
with the machine records.</p>

<p>6.17.2 Accuracy of Telecommunication of Voting Data </p>

<p>The controls are identical to those for ballot-tallying systems.</p>

<p>6.17.3 Vote Reconciliations</p>

<p>With a record of each undervote (recommended in section 6.10.1), two vote
reconciliations are then possible. One reconciliation should demonstrate an
equality in the sum of the number of votes and undervotes cast by each voter in
all contests. The second reconciliation considers each contest separately, and
should demonstrate that the sum of the number of votes and undervotes cast in
the contest is consistent with the number of voters who voted for the contest. </p>

<p>First, for every voter using the same ballot style, the sum of the votes and
undervotes cast is the same number, equal to the maximum number of votes that
could have been cast by a single voter in that ballot style. This simple
reconciliation is possible only because overvotes are prevented. A similar
reconciliation for ballot-tallying systems is more complex because, in general,
overvotes cannot be prevented.</p>

<p>Secondly, for each vote-for-N contest (N may be one or any higher integer),
the number of votes for candidates by all voters plus the number of undervotes
of all voters should equal N times the number of voters recorded as having
voted in the contest. </p>

<p>These reconciliations may be carried out for each individual DRE machine, as
well as for groups of machines. The calculation of these reconciliations, and
the demonstration of the equalities, should provide added confidence that the
DRE machines were performing correctly.</p>

<p>6.17.4 Recounting of Voter-Choice Sets </p>

<p>If the machine-generated voter-choice sets have been recorded on removable
storage media, it is an easy matter to recompute the machine-computed vote
summaries. It is recommended that this type of recount be carried out for at
least 1% of the precincts, using the complete voter-choice data for those
precincts. The recount should be carried out on an independently programmed
computer for which the removable media can provide data input. As pointed out
in section 3.7.2, this recount checks the machine's summarization process, not
the machine's recording of the voter's intent.</p>

<p>6.17.5 Post-Election Checkout</p>

<p>Each ballot position on a selected percentage of DRE machines used in an
election should be test-voted following the close of polls, to assure that each
was working correctly. Selection of some of the machines to be tested should be
granted to parties or candidates. If each contest on each machine had only two
alternatives, it would be possible to test each ballot position with the
casting of just two ballots, assuming no concern for interaction of selections
in different contests. As some contests have more alternatives, more than two
ballots would need to be cast to check all possibilities.</p>

<p>6.18 <u>The Recommendations In Relation To The Identified Problems<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p>In section 2.9, the problems of computerized vote-tallying were categorized
as follows: there is difficulty in verifying reported results (2.9.1), there is
the possibility of undiscoverable frauds (2.9.2), and election administrators
lack required technical knowledge and resources (2.9.3). The existence of these
problems have resulted in a continuing lack of confidence by technically
qualified observers in the running of computerized elections.</p>

<p>The most pertinent recommendations that respond to these problems are that
the concept of internal control should be extended so as to be applicable to
vote-tallying, and that persons knowledgeable in that professional field should
be utilized to assist in the establishment of sound operational procedures.</p>

<p>Extension of internal control to vote-tallying requires only the
re-definition of the concept of a transaction so that it is applicable to
non-financial operations. EDP auditors and internal auditors may be utilized to
recommend procedures that assure that results can be verified and that the
possibility of undiscoverable frauds is minimized. Specific internal controls
applicable to vote-tallying have been provided above. These controls respond to
the potential fraudulent manipulations identified in section 2.9.2, and to lack
of audit trails and poorly implemented administrative procedures, specified in
2.9.1, (a) and (d). </p>

<p>With the use of the services of knowledgeable professionals in internal
control (which includes computer security), and with the efforts of sources of
objective technical information (such as the Election Center), election
administrators would not be perceived to lack the technical knowledge and
resources necessary to overcome problems of computer use that cause unease
about reported results. The necessary knowledge required to assure integrity of
the vote-tallying process would be available in-house. Thus, administrative
errors should be minimized (2.9.3 (a)) and control of the process would not
have to be abdicated (2.9.3 (b)). The public would be able to receive
assurances that specific threats to system integrity were being adequately
handled. Improved confidence should result in reduced risk to vendors entering
the market (2.9.3 (d)), and therefore faster introduction of more effective
technology (2.9.3 (e)).</p>

<p>Other recommendations have concerned the performance of vote tallying
hardware and software, and assurance of their integrity. It is recommended that
the specifications developed by the FEC Clearinghouse be considered for
adoption by each State when they are issued. The availability of these
performance concepts and specifications provides election administrators with
additional knowledge and resources that can be used to acquire effectively
operating vote-tallying systems. This responds to the concern specified in
section 2.9.3 (c).</p>

<p>Tests of logical correctness of vote-tallying software are recommended as
part of a certification process, and recommendations are made concerning the
treatment of all software to minimize the possibility that operations will be
modified fraudulently by hidden code. The implementation of these
recommendations should provide additional confidence in the integrity of the
systems used to report election results. The certification process, including
its tests for logical correctness, responds specifically to the concerns about
the design of computer programs and their unavailability to the scrutiny of
responsible officials. These concerns were identified in sections 2.9.1 (b) and
(c).</p>
