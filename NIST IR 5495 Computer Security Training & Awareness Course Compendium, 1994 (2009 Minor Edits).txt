In the past audit software has been the domain of the I.S. auditor.  Recent technology  breakthroughs now
provide each internal and external auditor with software capability that  is easy to use and increases audit
coverage.  In preparing for the 21st century all audit departments require strategies to automate audits,
perform silent and remote audits and  improve audit productivity.  This seminar explores existing technologies
and provides participants with the knowledge to acquire, create and implement the software tools that  will
form the basis of the audit philosophy of the 21st century.

The open system concept has traditionally created a software dilemma for auditors in that computer assisted
audit techniques had to be rewritten for each mainframe and minicomputer.  Now PC based products enable
auditors to circumvent this situation to create software once for multiple platform execution.  This capability
not only provides significant economies of scale by reducing software development costs, but it also enables
greater consistency in audit software tests while maximizing auditor productivity.  The availability of pc
compatible tape drives and high capacity hard disks provide large file processing capability so that mainframe
applications can now be readily audited using the PC.

In addition to learning new techniques, participants will be provided with a free authorized demonstration copy
of ACL, the industry standard PC product for audit software.  Participants will then be able to reinforce what
they learned in the seminar with examples they can code and test when they return to the office so that they
can demonstrate the 21st century audit concept to their management.

This course is designed to provide the knowledge necessary for designers, developers reviewers
and approvers of new and updated Automated Information Systems to make sound decisions about
the security aspects of the system.  In particular, the primary audience is managers who are
responsible for system design and specification, program management, oversight, certification
and/or accreditation of Automated Information Systems.  The secondary audience for the course
includes staff from other disciplines, including technical staff personnel working in such areas as
system security, contracting, inspections or auditing, as well as members of the functional
community.  The course does lean towards Department of Defense (DoD)-level guidance for
security in the data processing environment, but the concepts presented are also applicable to non-DoD systems, and to DoD embedded and C3I systems, as well.

Security professionals have emphatically asserted that security issues must be considered from the
very beginning of the planning of the system, in order to avoid significant problems in terms of
cost, schedule, and operational capability that occur when the need for security is not recognized
until late in the system development process.  Therefore, the emphasis in this course is on the
early stages of system specification and acquisition, especially Functional Requirements
Definition, Security Requirements Definition, Concepts Development, and System Design.  The
principal notion conveyed is the importance of performing these and all other steps throughout the
development and acquisition process in such a manner as to facilitate the eventual accreditation
of the system.  Although the course is not oriented towards a security manager having operational
responsibilities (e.g., the Information System Security Officer for a local area network or for a
data processing installation), nevertheless many of the concepts taught are also applicable in an
operational environment.

600 Harrison Street
San Francisco CA  94107
(415) 905-2626

This workshop is for data processing managers, security officers, and auditors who have little or
no knowledge in the communications area.  Because communications systems are so complex and
vulnerable, the data processing operation is a substantial risk.  You will learn about the basic
concepts and the terminology needed to communicate effectively with technicians.  The emphasis,
however , is on vulnerabilities and the practical security safeguards you can implement.  Because
the largest communications risk faced by most organizations is unauthorized access to their
computers, considerable emphasis will be placed on how mainframe access control mechanisms
interface with other communication security techniques.  In particular, you will learn to address
the three major risks - loss of network service, unauthorized access to your network and data
center resources, and surveillance of your network traffic. "Special Note" You are encouraged to
prepare, in advance of the Workshop, a description of specific communications security problems
being faced within your own organization.  Cases will be discussed as time permits and as issues
arise during the Workshop.  NOTE: Ask about available discount for government hosted classes.

Mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures are common in today's corporate environment. 
Unfortunately, while these situations can create serious information protection problems, security
is usually considered only after the financial, legal, and structural issues have been settled.  This
seminar for security officers, DP managers, and auditors examines what to do before, during and
after a major organizational change to ensure the adequate controls are in place.  Computer
security problems in merger/acquisition/divestiture situations, and what we can do about them. 
How major internal reorganizations, functional, consolidation, and plant closings affect security. 
These days many large corporations are "outsourcing" - getting out of the DP business by
contracting all DP operations to an outside vendor. When this occurs, how do we ensure that the
vendor properly protects our sensitive data and applications?  What conditions increase an
organization's vulnerability?  Risk-reducing countermeasures.  NOTE: Ask about available

virus," and the fact that it may be a danger to their computers or data.  But it is hard to get good
answers to the questions of what, exactly, a virus is, how great a danger it represents, and how
to defend against any damage it might cause.  Covering technical details where necessary, but
always in non-technical language, this course will tell you what viri are, how they attack, how you
can defend against them, and what the existence of viri mean to you and your use of computers.
The course will give you a complete overview of all known ways that viri have "reproduced," and
the various types of damage they have done.  New viri are constantly being written so the course

UNIX is intended to be an easy-to-use system with great flexibility-this makes protection of UNIX
systems difficult.  The tutorial is focused on UNIX in general, rather than any particular vendor's
implementation, with many vendor-specific items provided throughout.  Included are tips and
techniques drawn from the instructor's years of experience as a UNIX system administrator,
incident investigator, security researcher, professor and consultant.  Both BSD and System V
versions of UNIX are covered in the material.

This course will start with the very basics about UNIX security, including some common threats,
what to monitor in the file system, standard but little-known tools and resources, how to secure
NFS/NIS, and how to deal with denial-of-service attacks.  More advanced topics include policy
formation, firewalls, Kerberos, X Window system security, some legal implications, and how to
write your own setuid/setgid programs.  The course provides tutorials in UNIX tools for the
system administrator.  these include using the Korn shell (ksh), the Awk scripting language, the
