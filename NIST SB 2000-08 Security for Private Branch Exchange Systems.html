      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hacker attacks on computer networks 
        are well known, but Private Branch Exchange (PBX) systems are also vulnerable. 
        In one case, a hacker penetrated the Private Branch Exchange (PBX) system 
        operated by a hospital in Escondido, California. For nearly two years, 
        on various occasions, he blocked calls to and from the hospital, connected 
        hospital operators to spurious numbers (including the county jail), and 
        placed bogus emergency calls that appeared to be coming from inside the 
        hospital.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, the hospital’s 
        experience is not unique. Failure to secure a PBX system can result in 
        exposing an organization to toll fraud, theft of proprietary, personal, 
        and confidential information, loss of revenue, or legal entanglements. 
        Depending on how the organization’s network is configured and administered, 
        information leading to intrusions of data networks may be compromised 
        as well. A PBX is a sophisticated computer-based switch that can be thought 
        of as essentially a small, in-house phone company for the organization 
        that operates it. Protection of the PBX is thus a high priority. This 
        bulletin introduces some of the vulnerabilities of PBX switches and describes 
        some countermeasures that can be used to increase the security of your 
        PBX. For a more detailed treatment of these issues, see NIST Special Publication 
        (SP) 800-24, <i>PBX Vulnerability Analysis</i> (see <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs</a>).</font></p>

      <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction</font></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Digital PBXs are widespread throughout 
        government and industry, having replaced their analog predecessors. Today, 
        even the most basic PBX systems have a wide range of capabilities that 
        were previously only available only in large-scale switches. These new 
        features have opened up many new opportunities for an adversary to attempt 
        to exploit the PBX, particular mostly by using the features for a purpose 
        that was never intended. The threats to PBX telephone systems are many, 
        depending on the goals of attackers. Threats include:</font><br>

      <UL>
        <li><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Theft of service</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">–i.e., 
          toll fraud, probably the most common of motives for attackers.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Disclosure of information</i>- 
          data disclosed without authorization, either by deliberate action or 
          by accident. Examples include both eavesdropping on conversations and 
          unauthorized access to routing and address data.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Data modification</i>- 
          data altered in some meaningful way by reordering, deleting, or modifying 
          it. For example, an intruder may change billing information or modify 
          system tables to gain additional services.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Unauthorized access</i>- 
          actions that permit an unauthorized user to gain access to system resources 
          or privileges.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Denial of service</i>- 
          actions that prevent the system from functioning in accordance with 
          its intended purpose. A piece of equipment or entity may be rendered 
          inoperable or forced to operate in a degraded state; time-dependent 
          operations may be delayed.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Traffic analysis</i>- 
          a form of passive attack in which an intruder observes information about 
          calls (although not necessarily the contents of the messages) and makes 
          inferences, e.g., from the source and destination numbers or frequency 
          and length of the messages. For example, an intruder observes a high 
          volume of calls between a company’s legal department and the Patent 
          Office and concludes that a patent is being filed.</font> 
      </ul>
      <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PBX Characteristics</font></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PBXs are sophisticated computer systems, 
        and many of the threats and vulnerabilities associated with operating 
        systems are shared by PBXs. There are two important ways, however, in 
        which PBX security is different from conventional operating system security:</font></p>
      <UL>
        <li><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">External access/control</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
          Like larger telephone switches, PBXs typically require remote maintenance 
          by the vendor. Instead of relying on local administrators to make operating 
          system updates and patches, organizations normally have updates installed 
          remotely by the switch manufacturer. This of course requires remote 
          maintenance ports and access to the switch by a potentially large pool 
          of outside parties.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Feature richness</i>. 
          The wide variety of features available on PBXs, particularly administrative 
          features and conference functions, provides the possibility of unexpected 
          attacks. An attacker may use a feature in a manner that was not intended 
          by its designers. Features may also interact in unpredictable ways, 
          even when implemented correctly, leading to system compromise even if 
          each component of the system conforms to its security requirements and 
          the system is operated and administrated correctly.</font>
      </ul>
      <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maintenance</font></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maintenance procedures are among 
        the most commonly exploited functions in networked systems. The problem 
        is even more acute with PBXs because PBX maintenance frequently requires 
        the involvement of outside personnel. Ways in which an adversary could 
        exploit vulnerabilities in maintenance features to gain unwanted access 
        to the switch follow.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Special Manufacturers Features</font></i></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There may be features that the manufacturer 
        will rely on in the event a customer’s PBX becomes disabled to such a 
        point that on-site maintenance personnel cannot resolve the problems. 
        The manufacturer could instruct the maintenance personnel to configure 
        and connect a modem to the maintenance port. The manufacturer may then 
        be able to dial in and use certain special features to resolve the problems 
        without sending a representative to the customer’s location. The potential 
        cost savings is a primary reason for adding such special features. A switch 
        manufacturer would not want the special features to be well known because 
        of their potential for misuse. These types of features may be accessible 
        via login IDs and passwords held privately by the manufacturer. Some possible 
        special features are listed below:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Database upload/download 
          utility:</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Such a 
          utility allows the manufacturer to download the database from a system 
          that is malfunctioning and examine it at their location to try to determine 
          the cause of the malfunction. It would also allow the manufacturer to 
          upload a new database to a PBX in the event that the database became 
          so corrupted that the system became inoperable. Compromise of such a 
          utility could allow an adversary to download a system’s database, insert 
          a Trojan horse, or otherwise modify it to allow special features to 
          be made available to the adversary, and upload the modified database 
          back into the system.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Database examine/modify 
          utility:</i> Such a utility allows the manufacturer to remotely examine 
          and modify a system’s database to repair damage caused by incorrect 
          configuration, design bugs, or tampering. This utility could also provide 
          an adversary with the ability to modify the database to gain access 
          to special features.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Software debugger/update 
          utility</i>: This type of utility gives the manufacturer the ability 
          to remotely debug a malfunctioning system. It also allows the manufacturer 
          to remotely update systems with bug fixes and software upgrades. Such 
          a utility could grant an adversary the same abilities. This is perhaps 
          the most dangerous vulnerability because access to the software would 
          give an adversary virtually unlimited access to the PBX and its associated 
          instruments.</font>
      </ul>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dial-Back Modem Vulnerabilities</font></i></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unattended remote access to a switch 
        clearly represents a vulnerability. Many organizations have employed dial-back 
        modems to control access to remote maintenance facilities. This access 
        control method works by identifying the incoming call, disconnecting the 
        circuit, and dialing the identified person or computer at a predetermined 
        telephone number. Although helpful, this form of access control is weak 
        because methods of defeating many dial-back modems are well known.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Countermeasures</font></i></b></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ensure that remote maintenance 
          access is normally blocked unless unattended access is required. Whenever 
          possible, require some involvement of local personnel in opening remote 
          maintenance ports.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Install two-factor (i.e., 
          two different mechanisms) strong authentication on remote maintenance 
          ports. Smart card-based systems or one-time password tokens, in addition 
          to conventional login/password functions, make it much more difficult 
          for attackers to breach your system’s security.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep maintenance terminals 
          in a locked, restricted area.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Turn off maintenance features 
          when not needed, if possible.</font>
      </ul>
      <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Administrative Databases</font></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Administrative databases represent 
        “the keys to the kingdom” for a PBX. Among the most critical security 
        tasks for PBX owners are administration of the PBX, the creation and modification 
        of its user databases, and the operating software controlling the switch.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Passwords</font></i></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most PBXs grant administrative access 
        to the system database through an Attendant Console or a generic dumb 
        terminal. Username/password combinations are often used to protect the 
        system from unwanted changes to the database. If remote access to the 
        maintenance features is available, some form of password protection usually 
        restricts it. There may be a single fixed maintenance account, multiple 
        fixed maintenance accounts, or general user-defined maintenance accounts. 
        The documentation provided with the PBX should state what type of maintenance 
        access is available.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Passwords may also be set to factory 
        default values that can be changed by the user. Default values are typically 
        published in the documentation provided with the PBX. If there are multiple 
        maintenance accounts and maintenance personnel use only one, the others 
        may remain at their published factory settings. Anyone who knew the factory 
        default settings could then gain access to the switch.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Physical Security</font></i></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Physical access to the PBX hardware 
        grants access to the software, the configuration database, and all calls 
        going in and out of the PBX. With access to the PBX, an adversary could 
        exploit practically any conceivable vulnerability.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The type of media on which the software 
        and databases are stored is important to a PBX’s physical security. If 
        these are stored on ROM-type devices or on an internal hard disk, it is 
        more difficult to gain access to them than if they are stored on floppy 
        disks or CD-ROM. ROM devices are mounted on circuit boards and may be 
        soldered rather than socketed, making removal and replacement difficult. 
        Likewise, an internal hard disk is probably mounted internally and bolted 
        to the chassis, making removal and replacement difficult. However, floppy 
        disks are easily removable and replaceable. An adversary with access to 
        the floppy disks could easily conceal a disk containing modified software/databases, 
        gain access to the PBX, and replace the original disk with the modified 
        disk. Similarly, CD-ROMs can be easily removed and replaced. Since equipment 
        for creating CD-ROMs is readily available, an adversary may find it equally 
        easy to copy and modify a CD-ROM-based system.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the PBX supports configuration 
        and maintenance via a dumb terminal, the terminal may be located near 
        the PBX. If the terminal is not at the same location as the PBX, the terminal 
        port is still available and could be used by an adversary with a PC acting 
        as a terminal.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some PBXs may be configured as a 
        central system unit with peripheral units at remote locations. The remote 
        peripheral units may also support configuration/maintenance via a dumb 
        terminal and therefore have the same vulnerabilities as the system unit’s 
        terminal. Also, all calls routed through a particular peripheral unit 
        are accessible to someone with physical access to the peripheral unit.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attendant Consoles may offer access 
        to PBX maintenance and configuration software. Special features may also 
        be available to Attendant Consoles such as Override, Forwarding, and Conferencing. 
        If any of these features are available to the user of an Attendant Console, 
        physical access to it should be restricted to prevent giving an adversary 
        access to these features.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most PBXs have an attached system 
        printer. Various information may be output to the printer including source 
        and destination of calls that are made or received (possibly every call), 
        access codes used to access certain features, account or authorization 
        codes used for making special calls, etc. Access to these printouts could 
        provide information enabling toll fraud or other compromises.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remote Access</font></i></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A very useful but potentially vulnerable 
        feature of many PBXs is remote administrative access. The PBX may allow 
        an administrator to make changes to the system configuration database 
        through an Attendant Console or from a terminal that is not physically 
        located near the PBX, perhaps over a dial-in line with a modem.</font></p>

      <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remote Access via an Attendant Console</font></i><br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The degree of the vulnerability created 
        by remote access via an Attendant Console is determined by several factors: 
        password access, physical connection of the Attendant Console to the PBX, 
        and availability of administrative features through the Attendant Console.</font></p>

      <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remote Access via a Terminal</font></i> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If a standard dumb terminal 
        can be used for access to the administrative features, more opportunities 
        become available for an adversary to gain unwanted access. A modem could 
        be connected to a terminal port and an outside dial-in line allowing easy 
        access for the PBX administrator to do remote configuration and maintenance. 
        Unfortunately, it also gives easy remote access to an adversary. By setting 
        up remote access in this manner, a poor password protection system, the 
        existence of “backdoors” (e.g., a special key sequence that would bypass 
        required authorization levels), or the use of easy-to-guess passwords 
        would seriously undermine the security of the system.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Software Loading and 
        Update Tampering</font></i></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When software is initially loaded 
        onto a PBX and when any software updates/patches are loaded, the PBX is 
        particularly vulnerable to software tampering. An adversary could intercept 
        a software update sent to a PBX administrator. The update could be modified 
        to allow special access or special features to the adversary. The modified 
        update would then be sent to the PBX administrator who would install the 
        update and unknowingly give the adversary unwanted access to the PBX.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Countermeasures</font></i></b></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps the most important 
          task for password security is to make passwords resistant to cracking 
          by automated tools. A password generator that creates random passwords 
          can go a long way in defeating password crackers. Both free and commercial 
          random password generation tools are available. Commercial products 
          are available that can generate passwords of user-selectable length 
          that are very resistant to cracking.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many software packages use 
          error detection codes to protect against transmission or disk copying 
          errors. Conventional error detection codes such as checksums or cyclical 
          redundancy checks (CRC) are not sufficient to ensure tamper detection. 
          Strong error detection based on cryptography must be used. These methods 
          use cryptographic algorithms that guarantee detection of even a single 
          bit modification.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of the potential 
          for exploitation by intruders, PBX boot disks and utilities must be 
          given more protection than usually afforded typical office software 
          such as word processing packages. Strong physical security should be 
          provided for PBX software. Audit reports from the PBX should be shredded 
          or destroyed in the same way as sensitive memos or financial information.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To ensure the security of 
          printouts, they must be shredded when discarded.</font>
      </ul>
      <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">User Features</font></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An adversary may be able to exploit 
        vulnerabilities in a system's features and the way in which features can 
        interact. As with many aspects of information technology, the proliferation 
        of features that make PBXs easy to configure and use has led to an expansion 
        of vulnerabilities. Many of these are inherent in the features themselves 
        or arise out of feature interactions, making them difficult to avoid. 
        This discussion illustrates some of these vulnerabilities so that administrators 
        will be able to weigh the risks of features against their benefits.</font></p>

      <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attendant Console</font></i><br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attendant Consoles typically have 
        more function keys and a larger alphanumeric display than standard instruments 
        to support the extra features available to the Attendant Console. The 
        Attendant Console may be used for access to maintenance and administrative 
        functions, but there are potential vulnerabilities of the Attendant Console 
        with respect to maintenance and administration. Some typical features 
        available with an Attendant Console are Override, Forwarding, and Conferencing.</font></p>

      <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attendant Override</font></i><br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attendant Override is intended to 
        allow the Attendant to break into a busy line to inform a user of an important 
        incoming call. An adversary with access to an Attendant Console could 
        use this feature to eavesdrop on conversations. The PBX should provide 
        for some protection against such uses of Override by providing visual 
        and/or audible warnings that an Override is in progress.</font></p>

      <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attendant Forwarding</font></i><br>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A common feature granted to the Attendant 
        is the ability to control forwarding of other instruments. An adversary 
        with access to the Attendant Console could use this feature to forward 
        any instrument's incoming calls to a long-distance number. The adversary 
        could then call the target instrument and be forwarded to the long-distance 
        number, thereby gaining free long-distance access.</font></p>

      <i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attendant Conferencing</font></i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attendants may also have the 
        ability to initiate a conference or join into an existing conference. 
        If this feature is available, the potential exists for an adversary logged 
        in as an attendant to eavesdrop on a conversation or add an additional 
        party to a conference without the knowledge of the other parties.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Automatic Call Distribution 
        (ACD)</font></i></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ACD allows a PBX to be configured 
        so that incoming calls are distributed to the next available agent (e.g., 
        reservation clerk) or placed on hold until an agent becomes available. 
        Agents may be grouped together with each group having a supervisor. The 
        group of supervisors may then even have a higher-level supervisor. The 
        number of supervisors and number of levels of supervisors is dependent 
        on the type of PBX being used.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most ACD systems grant a supervisor 
        the ability to monitor the calls of the group they are supervising. Because 
        of this feature, ACD systems are a potential vulnerability to the users 
        of PBX. If an adversary could gain access to the configuration tools or 
        the system database, they could become an ACD supervisor and set up an 
        ACD group. The supervisor could then monitor the calls of any of the users 
        in the group.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Account Codes/Authorization 
        Codes</font></i></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Account Codes are normally used for 
        tracking calls made by certain people or projects so that bills can be 
        charged appropriately. For example, a user may be required to enter an 
        Account Code prior to placing a long-distance call. Depending on the configuration 
        of the PBX, the Account Code may have to be on a list of approved codes 
        for the call to be successful. If this is the case, the Account Code may 
        be considered an Authorization Code because the user must dial a specific 
        Account Code that is authorized for making long-distance calls.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another important use for Access 
        Codes is for Dial In System Access (DISA). DISA typically allows a user 
        to dial in to the PBX system from an outside line and gain access to the 
        normal features of the PBX, almost as if they were a subscriber on the 
        PBX instead of an outside caller. This feature is typically used to allow 
        employees to make long-distance calls from the corporate PBX while out 
        of the office by dialing in to the switch, then entering a code to make 
        long-distance calls. It is easily abused by anyone with the authorization 
        code, possibly leading to large fraudulent long-distance charges.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certain Account Codes may also be 
        allocated for changing a user’s Class of Service (COS). When the COS is 
        changed, the user may have access to a different set of features. For 
        example, most instruments may be assigned a COS that does not permit the 
        use of an Override feature, but a special COS that is only accessible 
        by using an Account Code may be created that does permit the use of Override. 
        By using the Account Code, an adversary could then gain access to the 
        Override feature.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the Account Codes are used 
        for billing, there are records kept of the calls that are made for the 
        various Account Codes. These records generally include the source, destination, 
        Account Code, and time/date of the call. The records may be stored as 
        files on one of the system’s disks or they may be printed out on a system 
        printer. If the records are printed, an adversary who is able to gain 
        access to the printer will have access not only to traffic information, 
        but also to the printed Account Codes. Once the codes are known, the adversary 
        will be able to use the codes for toll fraud, additional feature access, 
        etc.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Override (Intrude)</font></i></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An Override or Intrude feature is 
        common to many PBXs. Due to its potential vulnerability, it is commonly 
        selectable as a feature that can be allowed/disallowed on a single instrument 
        or a group of instruments. Override is intended to allow one user (perhaps 
        a supervisor) to break into a busy line to inform another user (perhaps 
        a subordinate) of an important message. This feature could be used by 
        an adversary with access to any instrument permitted to use the Override 
        feature to eavesdrop on conversations. The PBX should provide for some 
        protection against such uses of Override by providing visual and/or audible 
        warnings that an Override is in progress.</font></p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Diagnostics</i></b></font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to the major diagnostic 
        features available at a maintenance terminal or Attendant Console, many 
        PBXs provide diagnostics that can be initiated from any instrument. These 
        diagnostic features may permit a user to make connections through the 
        PBX by bypassing normal call processing restrictions. An adversary with 
        access to these diagnostic features may be able to deny service or make 
        undetected connections allowing for the monitoring of other calls.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Feature Interaction</font></i></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the advent of the digital PBX 
        and its wealth of features, the interaction between features presents 
        a significant possibility for vulnerabilities. For example, in some systems 
        the return-call and camp-on features can be manipulated to defeat caller-ID 
        blocking. With the large number of features available in modern PBXs, 
        it becomes difficult for the manufacturer to consider all of the ways 
        in which different features may interact. Because of this, vulnerabilities 
        may exist that were undetected by the manufacturer that allow an adversary 
        unwanted access to the PBX and its instruments.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the actual Feature Interaction 
        vulnerabilities found on a specific system depend heavily on the particular 
        implementation of the features, it would be nearly impossible to describe 
        every possibility for a generic system. NIST SP 800-24 includes detailed 
        examples of some feature interactions.</font></p>

      <h3><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Countermeasures</font></i></b></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vulnerabilities can be minimized 
          if the Attendant Console connects to the PBX with a different physical 
          connection than that of the telephone instruments.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the Attendant console 
          connects to the PBX in the same manner as the telephone instruments, 
          vulnerabilities can be reduced by having some sort of line configuration 
          feature. Such a feature could reduce vulnerabilities by requiring that 
          a line be specifically configured for use with an Attendant Console. 
          With such a configuration requirement, a telephone instrument could 
          not be easily replaced with an Attendant Console to gain access to the 
          administrative features.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When implementing a Class 
          of Service, feature interaction should be given much thought. Many of 
          the feature vulnerabilities discussed involve Feature Interaction since 
          several COS items or system options may have to be enabled/disabled 
          to allow them to occur.<br>
          &nbsp; </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because the vulnerabilities 
          described in this section are inherent in feature implementation, they 
          are difficult to defend against. The most effective strategy is to ensure 
          that only essential features are activated.</font> 
      </ul>
      <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Computer Telephony</font></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the biggest new developments 
        in telecommunications is the advent of computer-based telephony systems 
        (CT). As microprocessor speeds have increased and memory prices dropped, 
        it has become possible to implement a PBX on little more than a high-end 
        PC. A CT system typically requires only the addition of specialized voice 
        processing boards to an ordinary office PC with 64 MB of memory, a 3 GB 
        disk, and a 300 MHz processor. Some CT systems use specialized real-time 
        operating systems, but the trend is toward commercial off-the-shelf systems 
        such as Windows, Linux, or other versions of UNIX. This development has 
        brought great reductions in the cost of PBX systems, but means the possibility 
        of enormously increased security risks. Two factors in particular can 
        increase exposure: greatly expanded integration of telephony with the 
        computer network and implementation of PBX functions over operating systems 
        with widely known vulnerabilities. Some of the features appearing in new 
        CT systems include:</font></p>
<ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Voice over IP,<br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Browser-based call handling 
          and administration,<br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Integration of IP PBX with 
          legacy PBXs and voicemail systems,<br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Integration of wireless 
          networks with office network systems, and<br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Virtual private networks.</font><br>
</ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A complete exposition of the risks 
        of CT systems is beyond the scope of this document. The safest course 
        of action is to assume that most or all of the vulnerabilities described 
        here apply to CT systems as well as traditional PBXs. CT systems may also 
        have added vulnerabilities resulting from well-known weaknesses of PC 
        operating systems. Future NIST publications may address CT security issues 
        in more depth.</font></p>

      <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recommendations</font></b></h3>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not all of the security measures 
        described in this bulletin will be applicable to every organization. The 
        first step in improving PBX security is to assess the organization’s current 
        telephony applications. This bulletin describes important areas to consider. 
        Following this assessment, NIST SP 800-24 can be used in conducting a 
        detailed evaluation. SP 800-24 also includes a set of baseline security 
        considerations for PBXs and a more complete set of countermeasures for 
        common vulnerabilities.</font></p>
