ENHANCEMENTS TO DATA ENCRYPTION AND DIGITAL SIGNATURE 
FEDERAL STANDARDS

To provide needed increased security protection of sensitive, unclassified information in 
federal computer systems, NIST's Information Technology Laboratory recently took 
steps to enhance two Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS): FIPS 46-2, Data 
Encryption Standard, and FIPS 186, Digital Signature Standard.  These two standards are 
discussed below.

DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD 

On January 15, 1999, a Federal Register notice announced the Draft FIPS 46-3, Data 
Encryption Standard, and requested comments from industry, government agencies, and 
the public on the draft standard. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) provides 
specifications for the Data Encryption Algorithm and is used by federal agencies (and 
others outside the government) for the protection of sensitive information. The DES, 
currently specified in FIPS 46-2, was due for review in December 1998. NIST proposes 
replacing FIPS 46-2 with FIPS 46-3 to provide for the use of Triple DES as specified in 
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X9.52 standard.

Background

FIPS 46, Data Encryption Standard, first issued in 1977, specifies the Data Encryption 
Algorithm for the cryptographic protection of computer data. The standard provided that 
it be reviewed within five (5) years to assess its adequacy. The first review was 
completed in 1983, and the standard was reaffirmed for federal government use (48 FR 
41062). The second review was completed in 1987, and the standard was again 
reaffirmed for federal government use (52 FR 7006) and re-issued as FIPS 46-1 with 
minor editorial updating. The third review was completed in 1993, and the standard was 
reaffirmed as FIPS 46-2 for federal government use (58 FR 69347). In addition to 
hardware implementations, FIPS 46-2 provided for software implementations of the DES. 
NIST now proposes to replace FIPS 46-2 with FIPS 46-3 to also allow for the use of 
Triple DES as described in ANSI X9.52.

When DES was reaffirmed in 1993, NIST stated in the announcement that NIST would 
"consider alternatives which offer a higher level of security" at the next review in 1998. 
After the first exhaustion of a DES key, NIST advised federal organizations that DES, 
properly used, still provided adequate security for many applications. At that time, NIST 
also stated that organizations needing security beyond that provided by the DES could 
use Triple DES as specified in ANSI X9.52.  NIST worked with the financial community 
to develop this standard. Triple DES is a method for using the DES algorithm in three 
operations.  These operations have been documented and specified as an American 
National Standard (ANSI X9.52) by Accredited Standards Committee X9 for Financial 
Services, which develops cryptography and public key infrastructure standards. The 
American Bankers Association is the secretariat for X9. See below for ordering 
information for the X9.52 standard.

Additionally, knowing that the DES' security life was nearing an end, NIST has been 
working with industry and the cryptographic community to develop an Advanced 
Encryption Standard (AES) for the 21st century. On January 2, 1997, NIST announced 
the initiation of an effort to develop the AES (62 FR 93). It is intended that the AES will 
specify an unclassified, publicly disclosed encryption algorithm capable of protecting 
sensitive government information well into the next century. Unfortunately, since it takes 
a substantial amount of time to gain confidence in a new encryption algorithm, the AES 
is not expected to be a fully developed FIPS for some time to come. Information on 
NIST's multi-year effort to develop the AES can be obtained at http://www.nist.gov/aes.

Use of Triple DES

Recently, claims have been made of a special-purpose hardware-based attack on the DES. 
In light of this most recent attack, NIST can no longer support the use of the DES for 
many applications. As with other security tools, encryption must balance cost against 
risk.  The recent brute force exhaustion attack by a "cracking machine" costing $250,000 
took 56 hours to crack a single message. With this special-purpose technology, the 
average time of cracking per message would be twice that, since only a quarter of all keys 
were tested. In some cases this kind of attack may not pose an immediate or significant 
threat -- for example where short-term protection of perishable information is desired. 
However, advances in technology are likely to further reduce the average cracking time. 
Therefore, NIST recommends the following:

-  For existing systems, develop a prudent transition strategy to move to Triple DES. This 
strategy should match the strength of the protective measures against the associated risk. 
Critical systems should receive priority; and

-  When building new systems, use Triple DES to protect sensitive, unclassified data.

These recommendations are reflected in the proposed draft FIPS 46-3 by recognizing 
Triple DES, as described in ANSI X9.52, as a FIPS-approved algorithm.

DIGITAL SIGNATURE STANDARD

A Federal Register notice of December 15, 1998, announced that the Secretary of 
Commerce had approved an interim final standard FIPS 186-1, Digital Signature 
Standard, and requested comments from the public, academic and research communities, 
manufacturers, voluntary standards organizations, and federal, state, and local 
government organizations. This interim final standard allows for both the use of the 
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) X9.31 standard by federal organizations.  The X9.31 standard describes the 
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) digital signature technique.  The effective date of the 
interim final standard is December 15, 1998.

Background

On May 10, 1994, the Secretary of Commerce approved FIPS 186, Digital Signature 
Standard, which specifies a single technique for the generation and verification of digital 
signatures. Recently, another technique, known as RSA, was approved as the X9.31 
standard [X9.31-1998 Digital Signatures Using Reversible Public Key Cryptography for 
the Financial Services Industry (rDSA)] by ANSI.  A second standard, based upon a 
technique known as elliptic curve, is expected to be completed and approved by ANSI in 
the near future.  Agencies have expressed considerable interest to NIST in using these 
technologies.

On May 13, 1997, NIST published a Federal Register notice soliciting comments on 
amending FIPS 186 to allow for the use of other techniques, specifically mentioning RSA 
and elliptic curve (but not with detailed specifications as now exist for RSA in the ANSI 
X9.31 standard). The public comments overwhelmingly supported revising FIPS 186 to 
include these additional algorithms. RSA, which has withstood widespread scrutiny by 
the cryptographic research community, is available in many commercial products. NIST 
believes it to be robust and sufficiently strong for use by federal agencies.

Interim Modification to FIPS 186

Following ANSI's recent approval of the ANSI X9.31 standard, the Secretary of 
Commerce approved an interim modification to FIPS 186 (FIPS 186-1) to approve the 
use of the digital signature technique specified in X9.31 in addition to the algorithm 
currently specified in FIPS 186. The Secretary's decision revises the old FIPS 186 by 
adding the following statements into the new FIPS 186-1:

-· Add the following as the last sentence of the "Applications" paragraph: The technique 
specified in ANSI X9.31 may be used in addition to the Digital Signature Algorithm 
(DSA) specified herein.

-· Add the following as the last two sentences of the "Implementations" paragraph: 
Agencies are advised that separate keys should be used for signature and confidentiality 
purposes when using the X9.31 standard. This is because the RSA algorithm can be used 
for both data encryption and digital signature purposes.

-· To minimize any potential for spoofing digital signatures, keys used for signature 
purposes should not be recoverable. Using separate keys will allow agencies to recover 
confidentiality keys but not signature keys.

The standard has also been modified to reflect the availability of conformity testing for 
DSA implementations. (ANSI's conformity testing program for X9.31 implementations is 
not yet in place.)  Minor language modifications (e.g., indicating that two algorithms are 
now approved) and other administrative updates have also been made to the standard.

Since ANSI's conformance testing program for the X9.31 standard is not yet in place, 
federal agencies are advised, in the interim, to acquire products that vendors hold out as 
in conformance with ANSI X9.31. Agencies will be advised by NIST when a 
conformance testing program is in effect.
