        Using malicious programs like WinNuke, Papa Smurf, and Teardrop, intruders 
        invade our privacy and undermine the integrity of our computers. In the 
        1999 Computer Security Institute/FBI computer crime survey, fifty-seven 
        percent of organizations cite their Internet connection as a "frequent 
        point of attack." Thirty percent reported that they had found actual intrusions 
        into their networks and 26 percent reported theft of proprietary information. 
        The incident handling entity for the civilian government, FedCIRC, reported 
        that 130,000 government sites totaling 1,100,000 hosts were subject to 
        attacks in 1998. Computer crime is substantial. It is clear that we must 
        increase our efforts to secure our systems and mitigate crime in the relatively 
        new medium of cyberspace.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In order to prevent attacks 
        in cyberspace, systems administrators need a high-level understanding 
        of the methods attackers use to penetrate computers. You cannot effectively 
        fight a war without some knowledge of the weapons of your enemy. The Information 
        Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, 
        researches the tricks of intruders and educates the public on how to stop 
        them. This bulletin:</font></p>

        of Attacker Tools</FONT></B><BR>
        Vast resources are available on the Internet that enable intruders to 
        penetrate computer networks. Detailed software vulnerability information 
        is publicly discussed on newsgroups. Attacking tutorials are available 
        that describe how to write automated programs that penetrate computers 
        by taking advantage of these vulnerabilities. Thousands of automated software 
        tools have been written that enable anyone to launch computer attacks. 
        Computer attacks are no longer found on obscure pirate bulletin boards 
        but rather on publicly available commercial Web sites whose sole purpose 
        is to serve up this information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> These computer attack programs 
        are freely available to anyone on the Internet. Besides being available, 
        these attacks are becoming easier to use. A few years ago, one had to 
        have Unix to run an attack and had to know how to compile source code. 
        Today, attacks with user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that 
        run on Windows hosts are available. Attack scripts are easy to use and 
        dangerous. It is vital that systems administrators understand the danger 
        these attacks pose and how to protect their networks against them. </font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">Classification 
        of Computer Attacks</FONT></B><BR>
        When we say "computer attack," we mean programs run by people to gain 
        unauthorized control over a computer. These attacks take a variety of 
        forms but generally fall in the following categories:</font></p>

        In March 1999, the most popular attacks (or vulnerable applications) found 
        by NIST were Sendmail, ICQ, Smurf, Teardrop, IMAP, Back Orifice, Netbus, 
        WinNuke, and Nmap. These are discussed below.</font></p>

        <LI> <font color="#000099" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Sendmail:</B></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Sendmail is an extremely old program that has had vulnerabilities throughout 
          its history. Sendmail is proof that complex software is rarely completely 
          patched because developers constantly add new features that introduce 
          new vulnerabilities. Recent attacks against sendmail fell into the categories 
          of remote penetration, local penetration, and remote denial of service.<BR>

          ICQ is a sophisticated chat program that stands for "I-Seek-You." It 
          is currently owned by America Online and used by over 26 million users. 
          In the past year, several ICQ attacks were developed that allowed one 
          to impersonate other people and decrypt "encrypted" traffic. An attacker 
          would use these attacks by going to a chat room and finding two people 
          that are friends. The attacker then pretends to be someone's friend 
          and sends them a Trojan horse (malicious code embedded into a legitimate 
          program) via ICQ.<BR>

          with a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to gain complete

        to Prevent the Majority of Computer Attacks</FONT></B><BR>
        Protecting one's networks from computer attacks is an ongoing and non-trivial 
        task; however, some simple security measures will stop the majority of 
        network penetration attempts. For example, a well-configured firewall 
        and an installed base of virus checkers will stop most computer attacks. 
        Here, we present a list of 14 different security measures that, if implemented, 
        will help secure a network.</font></p>

        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Patching</B><BR>
          Companies often release software patches in order to fix coding errors. 
          Unfixed, these errors often allow an attacker to penetrate a computer 
          system. Systems administrators should protect their most important systems 
          by constantly applying the most recent patches. However, it is difficult 
          to patch all hosts in a network because patches are released at a very 
          fast pace. Focus on patching the most important hosts and then implement 
          the other security solutions mentioned below. Patches usually must be 
          obtained from software vendors.<BR>
          &nbsp;<BR>
          </font>
        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Virus Detection</B><BR>
          Virus-checking programs are indispensable to any network security solution. 
          Virus checkers monitor computers and look for malicious code. One problem 
          with virus checkers is that one must install them on all computers for 
          maximum effectiveness. It is time-consuming to install the software 
          and requires updating monthly for maximum effectiveness. Users can be 
          trained to perform these updates but they can not be relied upon. In 
          addition to the normal virus checking on each computer, we recommend 
          that organizations scan e-mail attachments at the e-mail server. This 
          way, the majority of viruses are stopped before ever reaching the users.<BR>
          &nbsp;<BR>
          </font>
        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Firewalls</B><BR>
          Firewalls are the single most important security solution for protecting 
          one's network. Firewalls police the network traffic that enters and 
          leaves a network. The firewall may outright disallow some traffic or 
          may perform some sort of verification on other traffic. A well-configured 
          firewall will stop the majority of publicly available computer attacks. 
          <BR>

          </font>
        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Password Crackers</B><BR>
          Hackers often use little-known vulnerabilities in computers to steal 
          encrypted password files. They then use password-cracking programs that 
          can discover weak passwords within encrypted password files. Once a 
          weak password is discovered, the attacker can enter the computer as 
          a normal user and use a variety of tricks to gain complete control of 
          your computer and your network. While used by intruders, such programs 
          are invaluable to systems administrators. Systems administrators should 
          run password-cracking programs on their encrypted password files regularly 
          to discover weak passwords. <BR>
          &nbsp;<BR>
          </font>
        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Encryption</B><BR>
          Attackers often break into networks by listening to network traffic 
          at strategic locations and by parsing out clear text usernames and passwords. 
          Thus, remote password-protected connections should be encrypted. This 
          is especially true for remote connections over the Internet and connections 
          to the most critical servers. A variety of commercial and free products 
          are available to encrypt TCP/IP traffic.<BR>
          &nbsp;<BR>
          </font>
        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Vulnerability Scanners</B><BR>
          Vulnerability scanners are programs that scan a network looking for 
          computers that are vulnerable to attacks. The scanners have a large 
          database of vulnerabilities that they use to probe computers in order 
          to determine the vulnerable ones. Both commercial and free vulnerability 
          scanners exist.<BR>

        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Configuring Hosts for 
          Security</B><BR>
          Computers with newly installed operating systems are often vulnerable 
          to attack. The reason is that an operating system's installation programs 
          generally enable all available networking features. This allows an attacker 
          to explore the many avenues of attack. All unneeded network services 
          should be turned off.<BR>

          </font>
        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>War Dialing</B><BR>
          Users often bypass a site's network security schemes by allowing their 
          computers to receive incoming telephone calls. The user enables a modem 
          upon leaving work and then is able to dial in from home and use the 
          corporate network. Attackers use war dialing programs to call a large 
          number of telephone numbers looking for those computers allowed to receive 
          telephone calls. Since users set up these computers themselves, they 
          are often insecure and provide attackers a backdoor into the network. 
          Systems administrators should regularly use war dialers to discover 
          these back doors. Both commercial and free war dialers are readily available.<BR>

          Security advisories are warnings issued by incident response teams and 
          vendors about recently discovered computer vulnerabilities. Advisories 
          usually cover only the most important threats and thus are low-volume 
          and high-utility reading. They describe in general terms the threat 
          and give very specific solutions on how to plug the vulnerability. Excellent 
          security advisories are found from a variety of sources, but the most 
          popular come from the Carnegie Mellon Emergency Response Team at <a href="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.cert.org">http://www.cert.org</a>.<BR>

        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Intrusion Detection</B><BR>
          Intrusion detection systems detect computer attacks. They can be used 
          outside of a network's firewall to see what kinds of attacks are being 
          launched at a network. They can be used behind a network's firewall 
          to discover attacks that penetrate the firewall. They can be used within 
          a network to monitor insider attacks. Intrusion detection tools come 
          with many different capabilities and functionality. For a paper on the 
          uses and types of intrusion detection systems, see <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.icsa.net/services/consortia/intrusion/educational_material.shtml">http://www.icsa.net/services/consortia/intrusion/educational_material.shtml</A>.<BR>

          and Port Scanners</B><BR>
          Network discovery tools and port scanners map out networks and identify 
          the services running on each host. Attackers use these tools to find 
          vulnerable hosts and network services. Systems administrators use these 
          tools to monitor what host and network services are connected to their 
          network. Weak or improperly configured services and hosts can be found 
          and patched.<BR>

          Every network, no matter how secure, has some security events (even 
          if just false alarms). Staff must know beforehand how to handle these 
          events. Important points that must be resolved are: when should one 
          call law enforcement, when should one call an emergency response team, 
          when should network connections be severed, and what is the recovery 
          plan if an important server is compromised? CERT provides general incident 
          handling response capabilities for our nation, (<A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.cert.org">http://www.cert.org</A>). 
          FedCIRC is the incident response handling service for the civilian federal

        <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Security Policies</B><BR>
          The strength of a network security scheme is only as strong as the weakest 
          entry point. If different sites within an organization have different 
          security policies, one site can be compromised by the insecurity of 
          another. Organizations should write a security policy defining the level 
          of protection that they expect to be uniformly implemented. The most 
          important aspect of a policy is creating a uniform mandate on what traffic 
          is allowed through the organization's firewalls. The policy should also 
          define how and where security tools (e.g., intrusion detection or vulnerability 
          scanners) should be used in the network. To obtain uniform security, 
          the policy should define secure default configurations for different 
          types of hosts.<BR>

          (for firewalls and Web servers)</B><BR>
          Denial-of-service (DOS) attacks are very common on the Internet. Malicious 
          attackers shut down Web sites, reboot computers, or clog up networks 
          with junk packets. DOS attacks can be very serious, especially when 
          the attacker is clever enough to launch an ongoing, untraceable attack. 
          Sites serious about security can launch these same attacks against themselves 
          to determine how much damage can be done. We suggest that only very 
          experienced systems administrators or vulnerability analysis consultants 
          perform this type of analysis. </font>
