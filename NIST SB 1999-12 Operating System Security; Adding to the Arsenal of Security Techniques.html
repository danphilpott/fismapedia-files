      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        In recent bulletins and in the popular press, we have heard much about 
        a variety of advanced or enhanced security mechanisms such as firewalls, 
        intrusion detection, smart cards, public key infrastructure, digital signatures, 
        and others. Indeed, many organizations are investing scarce resources 
        in these mechanisms to secure their systems. Somewhat fewer organizations 
        are spending time and money on risk management, policy development, incident 
        handling, vulnerability analysis, security architecture, and other vital 
        activities. In spite of efforts made, many organizations still find themselves 
        quite vulnerable to attacks on their computers and networks. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the principal reasons 
        that organizations continue to have security problems is that application 
        software often contains numerous vulnerabilities. Many security systems 
        (such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and virus checkers) attempt 
        to protect these insecure applications by monitoring and filtering the 
        application's interactions with users. Each security product provides 
        a different monitoring or filtering technique and the use of multiple 
        techniques can form a strong barrier against attack. However, ultimately, 
        these barrier techniques are inadequate because users must be allowed 
        to interface directly with vulnerable software applications. If such software 
        contains a previously unknown vulnerability, then most likely an attacker 
        can exploit it without being stopped. Despite this, our best defense (apart 
        from building secure applications) is to install ever-stronger barriers 
        around our software. One of the best places for such a barrier is as close 
        to an application as possible: the operating system (OS). </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An OS has direct control over 
        applications and can provide strong security services to, and around, 
        an application. However, many OSs allow applications too much control 
        and thus vulnerabilities in applications often lead to complete compromises 
        of computers. OSs themselves often have flaws; nevertheless, much of the 
        public continues to purchase OSs known to be insecure even when given 
        the option for more secure systems. Some people knowingly buy insecure 
        systems because they prefer convenience to security. As computer security 
        incidents become more widespread and dangerous, this line of reasoning 
        may quickly change. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose of this bulletin 
        is twofold. First, it provides an overview of some security features that 
        have often been neglected in mainstream OSs. It describes the extent to 
        which these features have been implemented and how users can take full 
        advantage of the available capabilities. Second, it warns users that OS 
        security along with most other mainstream security mechanisms is imperfect 
        and cannot stop all attacks. Despite this fact, using a combination of 
        different security mechanisms can create a strong security barrier against 
        attacks. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques 
        can aid one in the development of appropriate security policies, risk 
        management plans, and in the purchase of security technology. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Important OS Security Features</b><br>
        OSs, which directly control applications, can create a strong shell of 
        security around inherently weak software. OSs can enhance security by 
        providing secure communications among applications, limit penetrated applications 
        from spreading their influence, and limit the leakage of critical information 
        out of an application. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several OS security mechanisms 
        are described here to demonstrate the importance of OS security in protecting 
        application software. These are trusted paths, least privilege, non-discretionary 
        access protection, and tokens. We cite these mechanisms as illustrative 
        examples of the importance of OS security, not as a comprehensive or exhaustive 
        list. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Trusted paths in OSs</u><br>
        A trusted path is a mechanism by which an entity (user, program, or hardware) 
        may directly communicate with another entity on a host. This communication 
        must have the properties that the communication cannot be intercepted 
        by another entity and that the two entities can mutually authenticate. 
        In the absence of a trusted-path mechanism, malicious software may impersonate 
        "trusted" software to the user or may impersonate the user to the trusted 
        function. This trusted-path feature defeats malicious software that would 
        attempt to masquerade as other software or software that would secretly 
        monitor keystrokes or inter-process messages. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Limited trusted-path capabilities 
        exist in some widely used OSs. Windows NT, for example, uses a trusted-path 
        mechanism to prevent Trojan horse programs from stealing logon passwords. 
        When users log into a Windows NT system, they should first press control-alt-delete 
        even if a logon window is already present. That keyboard signal causes 
        an exception handler to run that suspends all non-OS processes and then 
        presents a window to the user asking for a username and password. Thus, 
        assuming that the OS has not been compromised, the user has reasonable 
        confidence that the logon window is owned by the OS and not by malicious 
        code. Similarly, the user also has reasonable assurance that no application 
        apart from the OS is monitoring the user's keystrokes during logon. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the current Windows NT 
        trusted path is useful, OS vendors are working on further expanding this 
        capability to allow trusted paths between programs, the OS, hardware devices 
        (like smart cards), and users. The need for these expanded capabilities 
        was highlighted by recently documented attacks in which a Trojan horse 
        applet captured credit card numbers, PIN numbers, and passwords by emulating 
        a window system dialog box. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Implementing Least Privilege 
        in OSs</u><br>
        On any computer system, certain programs must be granted the ability to 
        bypass the security constraints normally imposed by the system. For example, 
        to create a backup of all files, an administrator must run a program that 
        is able to read all files even if the administrator is not normally allowed 
        such access. Other programs must also be given unusual system access, 
        such as the programs to shut down the system, create new users, and repair 
        damaged file systems. Historically, all of the programs that needed special 
        privileges were run using a user ID called root, superuser, or administrator. 
        This gave these programs that needed extra privileges complete control 
        of a host, including the ability to bypass all security restrictions and 
        limitations. This means that the backup program can be used to shut down 
        the system. The shutdown program can create new users, and the program 
        to create new user accounts can read all files on the system. The problem 
        with this is that if any of these privileged programs has an exploitable 
        bug, an attacker can use the program to do any action on the host. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To prevent this problem, some 
        OSs provide mechanisms by which one can assign programs only the specific 
        privileges that they need. This is done by breaking the root privilege 
        into a set of smaller privileges and thereby limiting the programs to 
        a relatively small set of privileges. By giving programs the least number 
        of privileges needed, a privileged program that is penetrated by a hacker 
        will not give the hacker complete control of the host. For example, a 
        program designed to eject a CD-ROM from a host has only the privilege 
        to control the CD-ROM drive and not the ability to read the password file. 
        A hacker then could not, as was recently done on a major OS, penetrate 
        the eject program and gain the ability to read the password file. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many versions of Unix are especially 
        susceptible to this problem, since hackers can easily take advantage of 
        the privileges of a penetrated program. When one program starts another, 
        a newly created program runs with the user ID of the first program. This 
        means that a malicious user who can exploit a bug in a root program may 
        be able to start up an interactive root session. If a user is running 
        as root, every program the user runs will have unlimited privileges on 
        the system. The user can create any file, modify any file, and delete 
        any file. The user can send and receive selected network packets, has 
        the ability to intercept all packets on the network, and thus can view 
        traffic between any two other hosts on the same network. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On many versions of Unix, the 
        most a system administrator can do to implement the least-privilege principle 
        is to give as few programs as possible root status. The granularity of 
        implementing least privilege in most version of Unix is to choose whether 
        or not a process should run as root. Some programs must be run as root 
        and there is no way around giving them complete control of the machine. 
        However, many administrators mistakenly run programs as root that could 
        be run under user accounts. System administrators should carefully evaluate 
        the privileged programs on critical servers and determine which, if any, 
        could be run with user privileges instead of as root. Ideally, standard 
        Unix versions would give system administrators the ability to implement 
        the least-privilege principle with much finer granularity. Several vendors, 
        however, do offer products that enhance the least-privilege capabilities 
        in Unix. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Window NT has a finer grained, 
        least-privilege mechanism for processes and users. Every Windows NT process 
        runs as some user identity. Every user identity in Windows NT can be given 
        a set of rights on that host. There exist at least 34 rights that can 
        be given or denied to each user account. Example rights include changing 
        the system time, managing security logs, accessing a computer over the 
        network, taking ownership of files, and creating users. Despite this advanced 
        least-privilege mechanism, all but two services (OS processes and programs 
        that run in the background) included with Windows NT must be run as the 
        system user which gives them complete control of the host. To fully take 
        advantage of the least-privilege mechanism available in Windows NT, system 
        administrators must create a separate user account for each service and 
        give it only the privileges needed to run that service. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The use of a strong, least-privilege 
        mechanism can eliminate many of the most commonly reported security problems 
        with standard OSs, including many buffer overflow attacks. Even if a specific 
        privileged program bug goes unfixed, use of the least-privilege principle 
        prevents the bug from allowing a malicious user to bypass system security 
        completely. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Non-Discretionary Protection 
        in OSs</u><br>
        Most OSs provide what is called discretionary access control. This allows 
        the owner of each file, not the system administrator, to control who can 
        read, write, and execute that particular file. Another access control 
        option is called non-discretionary access control. Non-discretionary access 
        control differs from discretionary access control in that the definition 
        of the access rules are tightly controlled by a security administrator 
        rather than by ordinary users. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Non-discretionary access control 
        can help ensure that system security features are enforced and tamperproof. 
        With this technique, security administrators can ensure that critical 
        files are properly write-protected and viewable by only a trusted set 
        of people. Non-discretionary mechanisms can also be used to protect against 
        inadvertent execution of untrustworthy applications since users can execute 
        only those programs that they are allowed to execute. With discretionary 
        access control, a user may have carefully defined a file protection policy 
        but a virus could change that policy, making the user's files open to 
        the world. This scenario is not possible in a non-discretionary access 
        control environment. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Non-discretionary access control 
        provides an organization with tighter security than is available with 
        discretionary access control. However, this comes at a cost. Additionally, 
        users may resist having file control policies specified by upper management. 
        Also, it is time-consuming to manage what groups of users should have 
        access to what files (although sophisticated software exists to make this 
        easier). Despite these drawbacks, organizations requiring a high level 
        of security, as well as organizations that cannot depend upon users' voluntary 
        adherence to site security policy, should consider non-discretionary access 
        control mechanisms. Non-discretionary access control capability can be 
        added to many OSs with add-on software. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Integration of OS with Security 
        Tokens</u><br>
        OSs in the near future will be tightly integrated with a variety of small 
        computing devices. These devices may take the form of electronically enhanced 
        cards, rings, or a variety of other wearable objects. Smart cards (credit 
        cards with embedded computer chips) are an example of such devices and 
        they are widely used in Europe. These devices can perform cryptographic 
        services to verify a person's identity, digitally sign transactions, or 
        scramble information so as to be readable by only the owner of the device. 
        OSs must tightly integrate with these devices so that rogue programs on 
        a host cannot deceive the devices into performing unauthorized encryption 
        services. Only those applications authorized by a user should be able 
        to perform transactions with the encryption device. To provide this type 
        of security, future OSs must be made aware of these devices and provide 
        trusted paths between the device and applications only when authorized 
        by the user. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Weaknesses of Barrier 
        Security Technologies</b><br>
        Past ITL Bulletins have recommended security techniques that can help 
        stop the majority of computer attacks. Some recent bulletins of this type 
        include:<br>
        </font>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- "Acquiring and Deploying 
          Intrusion Detection Systems" describes how intrusion detection systems 
          can detect attacks upon a network (November 1999) </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- "Securing Web Servers" 
          focuses on specialized issues and techniques for securing Web servers 
          (September 1999) </font>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- "Computer Attacks: What 
          They Are and How to Defend Against Them" provides general solutions 
          for protecting a network (May 1999)<br>
          </font>
      </ul>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These bulletins are available 
      on the Web at: <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistbul/</a>. 
      </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, no combination of 
        these security barrier techniques is sufficient to guarantee resistance 
        to determined attacks. This includes the use of OS security techniques. 
        Each technique has a weakness that can be mitigated by the use of multiple 
        barriers, but which ultimately will not be attack proof. Since users must 
        interface directly with insecure software, security barriers are unable 
        to stop attackers from exercising all application software flaws. In practice, 
        however, a combination of these techniques provides a reasonably strong 
        barrier against most attackers. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Using Patches to Enhance 
        Security</u><br>
        One of the most common methods for plugging known security flaws is the 
        installation of the latest vendor-supplied security patches. Patches are 
        programs that fix errors in software. However, patching systems is not 
        a perfect security solution. First, the constant stream of patches can 
        quickly overwhelm administrators who are already burdened with other administrative 
        tasks. Second, even though organizations install all of the latest patches, 
        new attacks via the Internet will continue. When new attacks are discovered 
        and published on the Internet, a large number of networks will become 
        instantly vulnerable to attack until new patches are created and installed. 
        Several weeks or months may elapse before an effective patch can be prepared 
        to counter a new attack, leaving affected servers wide open to attack. 
        Organizations can maintain their awareness about new patches by monitoring 
        security advisories about threatening or popular attacks. These advisories 
        are issued by a variety of organizations and usually reference a patch 
        or work-around that will fix the discussed vulnerability. The most popular 
        source of security advisories comes from the Carnegie Mellon Emergency 
        Response Team at <a href="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.cert.org">http://www.cert.org</a>.

        </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Firewalls</u><br>
        Firewalls police network traffic that enters and leaves a network. A firewall 
        may completely disallow some traffic or may perform some sort of verification 
        on traffic. These features enable well-configured firewalls to stop a 
        large number of publicly available attacks. For example, firewalls can 
        stop many TCP-based, denial-of-service attacks by analyzing TCP packets 
        and throwing away those that are maliciously formed. Firewalls can stop 
        many penetration attacks by disallowing many protocols that an attacker 
        could use to penetrate a network. By limiting access to host systems and 
        services, firewalls provide a necessary line of perimeter defense against 
        attack. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, firewalls do not, 
        in most environments, adequately reduce the risk for applications that 
        generate active content or implement transaction-oriented services. For 
        example, firewalls do not typically have the processing power or ability 
        to analyze downloaded Java&Ocirc; applets. As the term implies, a firewall 
        restricts overall access from an untrusted environment (the Internet) 
        to a friendly environment (the local company network). The new paradigm 
        of transaction-based Internet services makes these "perimeter" defenses 
        less effective as the boundaries between friendly and unfriendly environments 
        blur. A firewall controls broad access to all networks and resources that 
        lie "inside" it. Once packets from a user have traversed the firewall 
        and been authorized to enter the internal network, the firewall cannot 
        prevent access to or modification of specific resources-in the worst case, 
        the system security data itself. For Internet-based transaction systems, 
        the security mechanisms must be able to provide or deny access to particular 
        Web pages, applications, and databases on the basis of individual user 
        profiles or server authentication. Firewalls are unable to provide such 
        detailed security measures, important as they are to total systems security 
        solutions. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Virus Detection Software</u><br>
        Virus checkers monitor computers and look for malicious code. Virus checker 
        software must be installed on all computers that are to be monitored and 
        should be updated frequently for maximum effectiveness. Virus checkers 
        on e-mail servers that scan e-mail attachments should supplement virus 
        checkers on hosts. This way, the majority of viruses can be stopped before 
        they reach the users. However, virus-detection software can only detect 
        viruses that a vendor has analyzed and programmed into the software. Viruses 
        that are custom built by attackers for a particular organization or person 
        will escape detection. In addition, fast-spreading viruses can infect 
        large portions of the Internet before virus-detection manufacturers can 
        release software updates that fight the new threat. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Intrusion Detection</u><br>
        Intrusion detection is the process of detecting unauthorized use of, or 
        attack upon, a computer or network. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) 
        are software or hardware systems that detect such misuse. IDSs are effective 
        tools that should be employed by any large organization; however, they 
        are not standalone security mechanisms. IDSs, for the most part, detect 
        attacks that have occurred, but they usually cannot prevent attacks. Furthermore, 
        they normally are only able to detect attacks that have been previously 
        seen and analyzed by the IDS vendor. Thus, novel or recently published 
        attacks can be launched undetected against a network using IDSs. Some 
        IDSs can launch limited responses to detected attacks, but these responses 
        are usually not sufficient to stop sophisticated attackers. IDSs are strong 
        security mechanisms only when used in conjunction with a variety of preventative 
        security techniques. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Encryption</u><br>
        Some believe that when encryption becomes widely used, especially for 
        network connections, there will be no need for other security techniques. 
        Unfortunately, encryption does not provide a complete security solution. 
        Encryption can protect data in transit and can protect data stored on 
        a server, but attackers may still obtain the data in several ways. Whenever 
        the encrypted data is used, it must be first decrypted. A clever attacker 
        can simply copy the decrypted information as it is decrypted. This can 
        be accomplished by replacing the decryption program with a version that 
        allows the attacker to copy the decrypted data. Another technique is to 
        steal the encryption keys. These keys may reside unprotected on a host 
        or an attacker might have to monitor a user's keystrokes to discover these 
        passwords. Thus, data protected by a "strong" encryption system that would 
        take a supercomputer 100 years to crack can be recovered in seconds by 
        an attacker that steals the encryption keys. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Vulnerability Scanners</u><br>
        Vulnerability scanners are programs that scan a network or hosts looking 
        for computers that are vulnerable to attacks. Scanners use a large database 
        of identified vulnerabilities to probe computers in order to determine 
        the vulnerable ones. Both commercial and free vulnerability scanners are 
        available. They are very effective at finding vulnerable hosts, but they 
        can only look for previously identified vulnerabilities. Newly released 
        attacks and attacks that are not publicly known will not be revealed by 
        the use of vulnerability scanners. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Evaluations</u><br>
        Most security managers, already hard-pressed to maintain daily systems 
        operations, face significant barriers to incorporating new technologies 
        and adequate systems security. They depend almost exclusively on vendor 
        information about security performance when they install new software 
        or upgrade existing security software on their systems. Given the potential 
        implications of security system failure, it is critical that managers 
        seek out security solutions that have undergone independent evaluation, 
        testing, and validation. One of the largest evaluation efforts is the 
        National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) run jointly by NIST 
        and the National Security Agency. See <a href="http://niap.nist.gov/cc-scheme/">http://niap.nist.gov</a> 
        for details on evaluated products. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the use of evaluated 
        software is a necessary step in the direction of improved security, it 
        does not guarantee the security of an organization. Product evaluations 
        can find flaws and increase the level of trust in a product, but they 
        do not guarantee the absence of all flaws. Even when using evaluated products, 
        organizations must implement many other security mechanisms to create 
        an in-depth defense strategy. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion</b><br>
        The best known method of securing a network or host is to use multiple 
        security technologies together as part of a well-thought-out security 
        plan. Each security technology has a weakness, but together security devices 
        can create strong barriers against attacks. Outside audits of such security 
        plans can be beneficial by highlighting weak points. Be aware though, 
        that in general, no combination of security technologies can completely 
        secure an organization and one must be prepared to respond to successful 
        attacks. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OS security technologies necessarily 
        fit into any security plan because all of the applications one is trying 
        to defend run on top of OSs. One should ensure that the security capabilities 
        of an organization's OSs are fully utilized. Furthermore, one should plan 
        future OS purchases based on the security of the OS itself as well as 
        the security features it provides. More security-conscious organizations 
        should consider purchasing add-on software that enhances the security 
        of their OSs. </font>
